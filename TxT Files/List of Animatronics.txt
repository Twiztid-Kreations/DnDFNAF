TRAITS
Apparition Form. Golden Freddy can move through creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. He takes 5 (1d10) force damage if he ends his turn inside an object.

Sudden Manifestation. Golden Freddy can appear in any unoccupied space within 60 feet as a bonus action, even if a creature is looking directly at that spot. This teleportation does not provoke opportunity attacks.

Time Freeze (1/Turn). When Golden Freddy appears within 10 feet of a creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or lose its reaction and have its movement speed reduced to 0 until the start of its next turn, as time briefly halts for them.

False Reality. Spells that detect illusion, charm, or detect thoughts automatically fail against Golden Freddy. Creatures trying to interact with him must make an Intelligence (Arcana) or Wisdom (Insight) check DC 17 or believe he's an illusion.

ACTIONS
Haunting Glare. Ranged Spell Attack: +7 to hit, range 60 ft., one creature.
Hit: 21 (6d6) psychic damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be paralyzed with fear for 1 minute. The target may repeat the save at the end of each of its turns.

Mind Collapse (Recharge 5–6). Golden Freddy targets up to 3 creatures he can see within 60 feet. Each must succeed on a DC 16 Intelligence saving throw or:

Take 28 (8d6) psychic damage

Become stunned until the end of their next turn
If the saving throw is failed by 5 or more, the creature is also blinded for 1 minute.

Static Surge. All magical light sources within 60 feet flicker and extinguish. Nonmagical light is snuffed out for 1 minute. Creatures relying on vision in this area suffer disadvantage on all Wisdom (Perception) checks.

LEGENDARY ACTIONS
Golden Freddy can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. Golden Freddy regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.

Fade In/Out. Golden Freddy teleports to any space within 60 feet.

Jumpscare. One creature that can see Golden Freddy must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or take 14 (4d6) psychic damage and fall prone.

Blackout Reality (Costs 2 Actions). Golden Freddy becomes invisible until the end of his next turn. During this time, he can phase through solid objects as if they weren't there, and he doesn't provoke opportunity attacks.

LORE
"He doesn’t walk. He appears.
A flicker of gold. A warped laugh. A dead-eyed stare from nowhere.
Golden Freddy is more ghost than machine—perhaps a restless spirit, perhaps something worse. He warps perception, breaks minds, and shatters time with his presence. The less you know, the better… because the more you understand him, the closer he gets.*"
