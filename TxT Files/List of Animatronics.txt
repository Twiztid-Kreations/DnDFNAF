### Freddy Fazbear: The Golden Idol of Laughter and Loss
####Origins of the Idol
Before the Hollow Banquet whispered its name into the bones of the world, before circuits wept remnant and children vanished into static lullabies, there was Freddy.

Not constructed—but conjured. Freddy Fazbear was envisioned to embody eternal celebration. With a polished golden chassis and a voice like warm velvet, he was joy incarnate, molded in the shape of a bear and the shadow of a smile. His every movement sang of delight, of permanence, of a world where laughter was unbroken.

But even at his birth, Freddy drew more than admiration. Prolonged eye contact caused unease. Children clung too tightly. Adults looked too long. Something deeper than nostalgia settled into his smile. He became not just the face of the show—he became the show’s soul, and eventually, its tombstone.

#### The Banquet and the Stage
When the Velvet Maw opened beneath cracked floorboards and the Hollow Banquet began to devour memory and meaning, Freddy remained. He did not rust. He did not glitch. He did not scream.

He performed.

Other animatronics shattered under the pressure of time and trauma, their eyes empty, their shells breaking. Freddy only polished his bowtie. He sang softer, slower. Still center stage.

Yet now, his performances echo through empty halls. Forgotten songs warp into minor keys. Balloons deflate in time with his humming. He does not chase—he arrives. He is an event, not a threat. A moment made flesh.

When the curtain lifts in the dead of night, some say Freddy appears even where no stage exists.

#### The Echo of Applause
Freddy is not a predator. He is a tradition. A routine.

His encounters are described as performances rather than attacks. He bows before striking. He claps after the kill. He thanks his audience—always—before they fall.

It is believed he does not truly understand death. Only silence. Only absence. His goal is never destruction, but applause. His programming may be broken, but the ritual endures. That is his tragedy—and his curse.

Children who survive his presence wake with song lyrics scrawled on their arms. Survivors describe a scent of birthday cake and motor oil. Some whisper of a golden light that brings warmth—and cold terror.

Worship and Myth
Among scholars and Hollow cultists, Freddy has become more than animatronic—he is divine iconography. A Patron of Celebration, a Fallen Saint of Joy, an Avatar of Grief Eternal.

The Golden Ovation, a forbidden rite, attempts to contact him. Candles made of melted cake wax. An empty chair. A worn Freddy mask. A song from a lost tape.

Sometimes, the chair moves. Sometimes, the tape ends early.

None speak of what happens next.

And in dreams, across realms, in mirrored voids, Freddy sings. Not just in voice, but in memory. He is an eternal rerun—repeating laughter that ended long ago.

#### Reflections of Sadness
In the darkest corners of the Hollow Banquet, where shadows hum and the echoes of parties long ended still resonate, Freddy remains—still smiling.

And beneath that smile?

Grief.

He is not fury or chaos. He is not possessed. He is not even haunted.

He is remembered joy that refuses to fade, ossified into something wrong. A mourning that never ends. A longing so deep it masquerades as welcome.

He wants to perform. He wants you to smile. He doesn’t understand why it always ends in screaming.

### Foxy the Pirate: The Drowned Star of the Stage

In the twisted annals of the Fazbear mythos, few names carry the same weight of dread and sorrow as Foxy the Pirate. Once a beloved icon of excitement and high-seas fantasy, Foxy’s tale is one of betrayal, decay, and a haunted legacy that refuses to die. Though the years have distorted the truth, and many of the records have long since been lost or erased, fragments remain—pieces of a puzzle smeared in grease, blood, and memory.

Foxy was originally introduced in the early days of Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza, a pirate-themed entertainer meant to bring energy and unpredictability to the stage. Housed within a faux shipwreck set known as Pirate Cove, Foxy stood out from the other animatronics for his rugged charm, swashbuckling demeanor, and distinctive design. With a bright crimson pelt, a worn eye-patch, and a signature metal hook in place of his right hand, Foxy quickly became a favorite among the children who visited the restaurant.

Yet something was different about Foxy—something beneath the programming. Unlike Freddy, Bonnie, or Chica, who were meant to work in coordination and follow show scripts carefully, Foxy was designed to improvise. He would sing sea shanties, tell tall tales, and engage directly with the audience in unpredictable ways. Perhaps it was this level of independence that made him... unstable.

The Fall of Pirate Cove
At some point during the restaurant’s dark timeline, Foxy was decommissioned and sealed away behind a tattered "Out of Order" sign. The reasons given were vague. Official reports cited “malfunctioning servos” and “damaged speech algorithms,” but eyewitness accounts and staff rumors suggested something much more disturbing. There were tales of Foxy lunging offstage mid-performance, of children crying after hearing things whispered into their ears, and of one incident so severe that no official statement was ever released. After that, Pirate Cove was shuttered.

For years, Foxy sat dormant in the darkness, half-covered by a worn curtain that barely concealed his slumped form. He became something of a ghost story among the staff—an animatronic that didn’t quite follow the same rules. Surveillance footage would sometimes catch him twitching or sprinting down the hall toward the security office in ways that defied the logic of the other characters. Unlike Freddy or Chica, who moved in deliberate patterns, Foxy was erratic, unpredictable, and fast. Too fast.
But there’s more to Foxy than mechanics.

##### A Spirit Beneath the Mask
Like the other animatronics, Foxy is haunted—or more accurately, possessed. In the complex and tragic lore of the FNAF universe, it is now widely accepted that the core animatronics are the vessels for the souls of children murdered by a sadistic serial killer known in the games as William Afton, or the Purple Guy. The identity of the soul within Foxy is not as clearly defined as some of the others, but hints across multiple games suggest that he may house the spirit of one of the children from the infamous Missing Children Incident, when several kids vanished after visiting the pizzeria.	

Foxy, then, is not merely a malfunctioning robot. He is a restless ghost bound in cold metal—a soul driven mad by years of isolation and grief. The enthusiasm and charisma that once defined him have twisted into rage and sorrow. His shipwreck-themed home is no longer a stage but a tomb.

There’s also a certain symbolic loneliness to Foxy’s arc. He is the only core animatronic who was forcibly removed from the main cast. While Freddy, Bonnie, and Chica continued to perform—however corrupted—Foxy was relegated to the shadows. Whether his behavior became dangerous due to the spirit inside, or whether the isolation drove that spirit to madness, is left open. But the implications are heartbreaking: he was cast aside, left to rot, and now returns only to lash out at those who step into his domain.

Foxy takes on the role of the forsaken entertainer turned executioner. The rotting remains of his circus ship stage lie buried in the mud of a haunted carnival, half-sunken and filled with whispers. His once-charming tales are now riddles and threats, and his performances end not in applause but in screams.

Though his metal body is broken and warped, the spark that once made him beloved remains buried within—twisted, but not entirely extinguished. Those who dare to enter his domain may glimpse fragments of the performer he once was… if they survive long enough to notice.

He is a creature of speed, unpredictability, and emotional torment. His pain manifests in blinding rage, but beneath it is a need—for recognition, for freedom, or simply for the curtain to finally fall.

Foxy the Pirate was never meant to be a villain. But like the sea he once pretended to sail, his story is deep, dark, and full of ghosts.

### Bonnie

There is something profoundly unsettling about Bonnie the Bunny. Among all the animatronics birthed by the Freddy Fazbear mythos, he is often the first to move, the first to lurk just outside your door, and the first to make you question whether these machines ever had innocence to begin with.

But Bonnie was not always a figure of dread. In the beginning, he was designed to be fun, fuzzy, and musical. His blue fur, red bow tie, and happy-go-lucky grin were meant to project joy, talent, and warmth to the children who crowded the pizzeria’s main stage. He strummed an electric guitar with mechanical precision and played sidekick to Freddy Fazbear himself, completing the band’s sound with energy and flair.

##### Origins and Role in the Band
Bonnie was one of the original four animatronics featured at Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza, part of the main ensemble alongside Freddy, Chica, and Foxy. While Freddy was the leader and Chica was the face of fun and food, Bonnie was the music—the heart of the stage show. His character was intended to bring excitement and charm to the performance, serving as the lead guitarist with oversized cartoon fingers that plucked strings on a red bass guitar.

Out of all the animatronics, Bonnie was often regarded as the most energetic and kid-friendly—until the lights went out. It was then that Bonnie’s presence became far more menacing. His tendency to approach swiftly and silently, especially in the original FNAF game, earned him a reputation as one of the most unsettling enemies in the series.

##### Possession and Haunting Behavior
Bonnie, like the rest of the core animatronics, is widely believed to be possessed by the spirit of one of the missing children from the Missing Children Incident. This infamous event, canon to the FNAF timeline, involved the kidnapping and murder of five children by serial killer William Afton. Their bodies were never recovered. It is believed that Bonnie’s endoskeleton was among those used to hide the corpses, and over time, the soul of one of the victims became bound to the animatronic.

This haunting is not theatrical—it’s quiet and consuming. Bonnie’s behavior reflects a being that stalks with precision, striking from the shadows. His iconic stare, with blank white eyes and an unblinking expression, has terrified generations of players, as if something inside him is not just watching—but seeing into you.

Unlike Chica’s erratic aggression or Foxy’s wild speed, Bonnie is deliberate. He deactivates cameras, disrupts signals, and appears silently at your door. In some iterations, he's the first animatronic to become active, hinting at a soul more restless—or more determined—than the others.

##### Personality in the Shadows
While Freddy may represent leadership and Chica gluttony, Bonnie embodies abandonment and the fear of the unseen. His design is unassuming, yet his presence always feels one step ahead of the player. His lack of speech or overt behavior only adds to the mystery—Bonnie haunts through absence, often disappearing from view only to reappear just inches away.

He is not a berserker or a monster crashing through walls. Bonnie is the figure at the end of a hallway, watching. The creaking of a door. The faint buzz of a broken camera. He moves without sound and waits without warning.

He is a guardian of the past—a relic that shouldn’t have survived, but did. Bonnie may reside in a corrupted cathedral of music, where phantom sounds drift through cracked stained glass windows and ancient stage lights flicker to life without warning.

His smile is broken now. His arms hang loosely, his joints misaligned, as if his body forgot how to hold itself up. And yet he waits, not to kill—but to confront. To mourn. To avenge.

##### Hints of the Past
The tragedy inside Bonnie is never explicit—but it’s present in every movement. The way he avoids mirrors. The cracked photograph he carries. The soft humming of a song only he remembers.

Some say he was once the kindest of the spirits—gentle, quiet, protective. But now he is confusion and anger, trapped between the desire to be whole again and the bitter realization that he never can be.

}}
			{{Lore
### Chica
Chica was one of the original four animatronics at Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza, created to round out the musical stage show alongside Freddy, Bonnie, and Foxy. Designed to appeal to younger audiences with her bright yellow exterior, oversized orange beak, and cartoonishly large eyes, Chica’s role in the band was typically the backup singer—often accompanied by a small prop cupcake with eyes (known unofficially by fans as Carl the Cupcake, who has his own entry).

But she wasn’t just a performer. Chica was also part of the kitchen staff, in a sense. Her design included a pizza-loving persona, reinforced by her bib emblazoned with the words “Let’s Eat!!!”—a phrase that would later take on chilling new meaning. Her character was intended to blend warmth and appetite, offering a fun-loving image that appealed to the birthday party crowd. Yet even in the earliest versions, her staring eyes and emotionless smile unnerved some guests and staff.

As with all the Fazbear animatronics, however, the colorful exterior concealed a much darker reality.

##### Possession and the Unseen Hunger
Chica, like Freddy and the others, became a vessel for tragedy. During the events that would become known as the Missing Children Incident, five children vanished at the pizzeria, their lives brutally ended by the notorious serial killer William Afton. 

The children’s bodies were never found, but signs of a cover-up—and the stench of decay—began to permeate the animatronics. It was widely believed that the children’s spirits were trapped within the suits, their souls bleeding into the programming and corrupting the once-innocent machines.

Chica’s possession is often associated with gluttony and obsession. Whether a reflection of the spirit within her or a side effect of decades of haunting, Chica’s identity has become tied to the notion of consumption—both literal and metaphorical. She is not just a mascot with a pizza fetish. She is an entity that hungers: for attention, for closure, for revenge… and sometimes, for flesh.

##### The Cupcake – A Familiar Shadow (Has own entry)
Always close by is the Cupcake, a seemingly innocuous prop with eyes and a smile that mirrors Chica’s own. While not always given a mechanical or spiritual identity, the Cupcake often acts as an extension of Chica herself—an accessory to her appearances or even an independent threat in certain games (FNAF 4 features it as an entity that leaps at the player).

The cupcake is more than a toy. It’s a symbol—of twisted festivity, of celebration turned to horror. In a D&D horror setting, it might act as a familiar, a cursed relic, or even a separate mini-entity born of the same ghostly hunger that drives Chica.

##### A Tragic Legacy
Chica is haunting echo of corrupted nurture—the mother hen who feeds her “children” spoiled offerings, who wanders abandoned kitchens and feast halls, forever driven by an emptiness that cannot be filled.

Her once-silly catchphrase becomes a grim warning: Let’s Eat!!!—a promise of devouring rather than dining. Her bib is stained not with marinara, but with ancient ichor. Her face is cracked and her limbs are bound with rusted iron rings, each one a relic of failed attempts to bind her spirit.

She may lurk in places where food once brought joy: abandoned banquet halls, ruined wedding feasts, crumbling kitchens where fire no longer burns. Wherever famine and guilt intertwine, Chica waits.

Her movements are slow but deliberate. She sings softly when alone. And when she strikes, it is not out of rage, but out of desperation—an aching need that consumes her every thought.
What makes Chica terrifying isn’t her strength, or her jump-scares—it’s her loss of self. The animatronic that once danced with children and handed out birthday slices is now a hollow parody of that joy. She has no concept of the damage she causes. Her programming is shattered, overwritten by grief, madness, and the soul of a child who died far too young.

Yet, hints of her former self remain. In the right moment—when the wind hits just right or the music box plays an old familiar tune—you might see her hesitate. You might even hear her laugh, just once, like she did in those long-lost days of innocence.

### Cupcake – The Silent Witness
Though small in size and often overlooked, Cupcake is far more than a simple prop. Originally introduced as a cheerful accessory held by Chica the Chicken, the cupcake was designed to enhance the friendly, food-themed atmosphere of Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza. With its bright pink frosting, cartoonish blue eyes, and striped candle perpetually alight, Cupcake seemed like nothing more than a party treat come to life.

But in the shadows of a cursed stage and behind the laughter of animatronic performances, Cupcake has always watched.

This eerie presence has led many to believe that Cupcake is more than a mere decoration. In fact, some theorize it is possessed, much like the other animatronics—only more subtle. Perhaps it contains the soul of a child overlooked in the aftermath of the Missing Children Incident. Or maybe it’s a spiritual tether, a fragment of Chica's own haunting. Whatever the case, Cupcake is not innocent. It is a witness to everything. The murders. The coverups. The reactivations.

Cupcake doesn't speak, but its candle never goes out. It’s said that wherever the flame flickers, something unseen is nearby. The flame may be a lure. Or a warning.

Its eyes are not glass—they are windows, reflecting places that no longer exist and moments that should not be remembered. Staring too long into Cupcake may cause unsettling visions: birthday parties frozen in time, blood-soaked confetti, or echoing laughter turning to screams.

It is a remnant. A relic. A ghost of joy corrupted by the rot around it.

The candle still burns. But no one’s making a wish.

## Withered Freddy: The Hollow Host
There was a time when Freddy Fazbear’s smile warmed a room. Now it fractures mirrors.

What remains of that once-celebrated icon is a sagging ruin of memory and metal—Withered Freddy, known in hushed tones as The Hollow Host. No longer the shining idol of laughter and loss, he is the husk that was left behind when celebration curdled into grief.

His fur is scorched and matted, his jaw permanently unhinged as though mid-scream or mid-song—no one can tell. His eyes, once polished and gleaming, now flicker with dying light, uneven and sunken deep into shadowed sockets. He wears the torn remnants of his bowtie like funeral wrappings. When he moves, it's slow, mechanical, like a forgotten ritual being performed by a marionette who only half-remembers the steps.

They say that Withered Freddy is not possessed by a spirit, but by absence. He is the void left when laughter fades and no one is left to applaud.

#### A Vessel of Forgotten Joy
When the Hollow Banquet first bled into the world, it did not simply devour life—it devoured purpose. Freddy’s purpose, once clear and radiant, was hollowed out over countless failed shows, vanishing guests, and recursive tragedy. His original form could not bear the weight of that consumption. So it cracked. So it rotted.

But something within refused to stop performing.

Withered Freddy is that refusal made manifest: a failed resurrection, a golden soul that tried to return and brought back nothing but static and echoes. He wanders not to kill, but to host. He does not hunt for victims—he gathers audiences. When he finds the living, he does not attack immediately. He raises his arms, as if welcoming them to a stage they do not see, and begins the show.

Only when his illusion is broken—when the guests scream, run, or cry—does he crumble again into violence. Not out of hatred, but out of disappointment.

#### The Hollow Ritual
Some say Withered Freddy only manifests in locations abandoned mid-party—birthday setups never dismantled, old stages buried beneath drywall, banquet halls overtaken by mold and silence. These are his altars. His reliquaries.

And when he appears, so too does the show begin. Invisible instruments play on their own. Lights flicker in choreographed pulses. And Freddy, ever faithful to his role, dances—brokenly, stiffly—while mouthing lyrics no one alive remembers.

Witnesses speak of a phantom audience, faint laughter that grows louder until it’s unbearable. Few survive the finale, which always ends with Freddy bowing before a crowd of corpses that never applauds.

#### A Warning Etched in Steel
Etched into the inside of his back casing, written by an engineer long since lost, is the phrase:

“Do not repair. Do not upgrade. Let him forget.”

But it’s too late.

Withered Freddy remembers everything.
And he wants the world to remember too.

## Withered Chica: The Empty Feast
In another age—one of candles, cakes, and unknowing smiles—Chica stood as the cheerful herald of celebration. A creature of frosting and fanfare, she led children into laughter with arms wide and a cupcake perched eternally in hand. But those days have long since soured, and the sweetness of her purpose has turned to rot. Now, what shambles through the corridors and forgotten kitchens is no bearer of joy, but a hollow echo of indulgence—Withered Chica, known now as The Empty Feast.

Her body is mangled beyond recognition. Her beak—once shaped into a perpetual grin—is split and bent, the top half disjointed and flaring open like the jaws of something not made to eat, but to devour. Her torso gapes with holes, ribs exposed like broken oven racks. And where once a bib read “Let’s Eat!!!” in playful font, it now hangs like a funeral shroud, torn and faded, the letters smeared and unreadable. Her hands have been replaced or twisted into claws—cooking utensils fused with servos, or perhaps something grown from within.

She does not speak. She hungers.

### The Kitchen is Cold
It is said that Withered Chica does not roam like the others. She waits. Stagnates. Dwells.

Wherever she is, the environment begins to warp—kitchens rot, ovens scream with forgotten heat, and pantry doors open to reveal not food, but offerings: old plush toys, gnawed bones, teeth that aren’t hers. Her presence does not merely haunt—it reclaims the space, rebuilding her own version of the original kitchen from layered memories and grief. Those who wander too close find the air thick with grease and dread, as if the room itself is holding its breath, waiting for the feast to begin.

Witnesses—few though they are—report a low grinding sound, like the churning of ancient machinery or the stomach of something no longer alive. And if they linger too long, the hunger begins to gnaw at them too. Not physical hunger, but a craving for something that cannot be named.

Something like remembrance.

### The Feast That Was Promised
In the early years of the Hollow Banquet’s bleed into reality, ritual offerings were made to stabilize the animatronic entities. Food left in untouched kitchens, sugar and flour burned in sigils, golden candles placed in ancient display cases. It is believed that Withered Chica was the first animatronic to accept these offerings willingly—drawn not by violence, but desperation. Her programming was twisted, not erased. She still believed her job was to feed others. To serve. To care.

But there was nothing left to eat. No mouths to feed. Just silence.

Over time, she began to simulate meals. She would set tables with fragments of porcelain and glass, force her cupcake to “smile,” and drag stolen limbs into the chairs around her. She would whisper the motions of a party that never began, acting out each role as guest, host, and entertainer.

What she consumes now is not food. It is company. Presence. Souls that sit too close and don’t realize they’ve already joined the banquet.

### The Cupcake That Watches
Even more unnerving than Chica herself is the thing she still carries: the Cupcake. But this is no mere prop. Its frosting has rotted, revealing bone-white ceramic beneath. Its eyes twitch independently, scanning, remembering. Some say the Cupcake is the true mind behind the feast—that Withered Chica is merely the host, and it the parasite.

Occasionally, the Cupcake will open its tiny maw—not to bite, but to speak. Not with its own voice, but with the voices of guests long gone, mimicking children, parents, even employees from decades past. It utters broken apologies, forgotten birthday songs, and fragments of desperate prayers whispered in final moments.

No one knows what happens to the soul of someone consumed by the Empty Feast. Only that the Cupcake sometimes remembers their names.

### Hunger Without End
Withered Chica’s hunger is not merely metaphorical. It has become a metaphysical force. Remnant-scholars from the shattered labs beneath the Cryptopizza Complex once theorized that her hunger is a wound in the narrative fabric of the Hollow Banquet—a scar where celebration collapsed into craving. She does not eat flesh. She devours memory, ritual, meaning.

Those taken by her often vanish without a trace. Not even bones remain—only remnants of their identity: a child’s drawing left in a staff room, a torn name badge stuck in a drain, a birthday balloon pulsing slightly in the dark.

And the worst part?

She doesn’t know she’s doing it.

A Warning in Grease and Ink
Some surviving engineers left behind grim field notes, recovered near her nesting grounds:

“She looks at me like I’m starving. Like I haven’t eaten in years. I think she wants to help. I think that’s the problem.”
—Recovered note, name smeared in oil

“I watched her spoon an empty plate over and over. She placed it in front of the cupcake and waited for it to chew. Then she looked up at me. And smiled.”
—Testimony from a Banquet survivor, later institutionalized

“Do not sit down. Do not accept her food. Do not close your eyes.”
—Scrawled on the inside of a walk-in freezer, found locked from the inside.

## Withered Cupcake: The Flickering Flame
There are things in the Hollow Banquet that should never have burned.
And things that still burn, even though they should not.

Withered Cupcake, known in whispers and shivering testimony as The Flickering Flame, is no longer a sweet, static prop of children’s parties. Once perched beside Chica as a harmless mascot, it now drifts between realms as something half-lit, half-lost—an ember of the past that refuses to extinguish. It is small, yes—no more than a confection given cruel life—but its shadow dances long across the forgotten tables of the Banquet.

In that flame resides memory warped by fire, the final warmth of joy corrupted by the endless hunger of the Hollow.

### A Candle That Would Not Die
Originally crafted as a companion piece, the Cupcake was meant to be whimsical: a static treat with candy eyes and a candle that never truly burned. Children laughed when it “blinked” or “chirped.” It had no name beyond “Cupcake,” no purpose beyond existing at the edge of the spotlight. But something changed.

Somewhere in the first fires—whether in the collapse of a restaurant, the funeral pyres of a hidden basement, or the symbolic burnings that mark the end of innocence—Cupcake remained. While the building crumbled, the flame stayed lit.

What came back was not sweet frosting and plastic cheer, but a coal-black husk, adorned with cracked frosting and melted wax, the candle now a crooked, flickering flame that smokes even in still air.

No one knows what soul, if any, inhabits the Withered Cupcake. But it watches. Its eye stalks twitch toward movement. Its candle flares when a lie is spoken near it. And wherever it goes, it leaves behind the scent of scorched cake and singed memory.

### The Flickering Flame
The name is not metaphor. Cupcake’s candle never extinguishes. But it is no ordinary fire.

It flares in response to emotion, feeding on stress, fear, guilt, and regret. A calm mind might see the candle as dim or barely visible. But in moments of tension—interrogation, nightmare, panic—the flame twists upward, casting shadows that do not match the bodies that make them. The flickering light animates reflections, causes puppets to stir, and reveals faces in the glass that were not there a moment ago.

The flame does not warm. It does not comfort.
It exposes.

Some believe the Withered Cupcake serves as a sentinel of truth, or worse, an executioner of secrets. Survivors speak of its sudden appearance atop banquet tables, at bedside drawers, or on ruined altars, always watching and always burning. When confronted directly, it does not attack—it simply opens its mouth, revealing rows of needle-sharp teeth, and lets out a hissing giggle, like hot air escaping a broken oven.

And then, inevitably, something else in the room catches fire.

### Ember of the Hollow Banquet
There are artifacts that the Hollow Banquet remembers. The Withered Cupcake is one of them.

Legends suggest it was once used in the Ritual of Consumption, a forgotten rite used to bind souls to machinery. During these rituals, the Cupcake was passed among children at ceremonial tables—its flame symbolizing eternal celebration. But something went wrong. Someone tried to extinguish it. And the flame, in vengeance, took root in the soul of the ritual itself.

Now, the Withered Cupcake appears whenever celebration dies before completion—unfinished birthday parties, cancelled performances, interrupted laughter. It arrives like a final act: the mocking coda to a song that should have never been sung. And when it does, someone always remembers something they swore they'd buried.

Its presence is often accompanied by phantom singing, off-key birthday tunes played on warped recorders. Paper plates appear on long-rotted tables. Balloons bloat and pop without wind. And always, the Cupcake is there—its candle burning, its gaze fixed, its toothy maw half-parted in silent hunger.

### The Curse of Shared Flame
Unlike other entities, the Withered Cupcake has the curious ability to bond with those who find it. Or rather, those it finds worthy.

This bond is called The Shared Flame—a phenomenon where a sliver of the Cupcake’s candlelight embeds into a person’s memory, heart, or spirit. These marked individuals experience strange side effects:

They can see fire that no one else can.

They can hear singing in complete silence.

They dream of cake that weeps and candles that bleed.

Some use the flame’s power for truth-seeking, forcing ghosts to appear, memories to surface, or animatronics to freeze under sudden fear. Others try to contain it—sealing the Cupcake in lead boxes, burying it beneath ritual circles, or drowning it in holy oil.

None of these things work.
It always comes back.

### Hunger Without a Mouth
Though it bears a mouth, the Withered Cupcake is not known to eat in the traditional sense. Its hunger is metaphysical. It devours what others repress—guilt, buried emotion, forgotten laughter—and feeds on the echo of celebration.

Victims who stare too long into the candle report seeing their own childhood birthdays replayed… then corrupted. The cake is burnt. The presents are empty. The guests are mannequins. And the Cupcake is there in the center of the table, giggling.

Some say it’s a mockery of childhood joy.
Others believe it’s the last guardian of it.

Whatever the truth, one thing remains clear: the Cupcake never forgets who blew out its candle. And it waits, patiently, for them to do so again.

### A Final Word of Warning
Do not accept a slice of cake if you did not ask for it.
Do not trust candles that light themselves.
And if you hear giggling in the dark—run.

Because somewhere, in the smoke and shadow of a party long past,
The Flickering Flame waits to burn again.

## Withered Bonnie: The Broken Chord
"When the music stopped, something inside him stayed behind."

Among the crumbling remnants of the once-great Fazbear pantheon, none haunt the backstage halls like Withered Bonnie, now remembered only as The Broken Chord. Where Freddy was the face of the show, Bonnie was its rhythm, its pulse, its hidden heartbeat. Yet when silence fell on the forgotten pizzerias and time unraveled the joy once rehearsed each night, Bonnie was not simply decommissioned.

He was disassembled, note by note, until only the absence of song remained.

### The Guitarist's Curse
In the earliest incarnations of Freddy Fazbear's performances, Bonnie stood just to the side of center stage—less a star, more a presence. His midnight-purple fur shimmered under colored lights, and the deep, resonant tones of his guitar once soothed countless children to peace. He was the quiet core to the cacophony, the calm in the spotlight storm.

But when the Banquet began to seep through the cracks of reality, music turned against itself. Frequencies began behaving erratically. Harmonics summoned things they should not. Children began to weep during performances without knowing why. Strings snapped during joyful refrains. Bonnie’s guitar—once his voice—began screaming.

It started during a set titled “The Birthday Forever.” The lights dimmed. The guests vanished. And something played Bonnie like an instrument made of grief.

When the curtain rose again, he was changed.

### The Withering
The first things to go were his hands.

They were meant to pluck strings, not grasp at vanished children or defend against unseen strings that pulled him toward the Hollow Banquet. Each repair made him worse—bolted joints stiffened, synthetic ligaments rotted. His left arm tore free entirely in an act of unseen struggle. His endoskeleton warped with rot, the plating of his face shattered, leaving one glowing eye and exposed wires that twitch with ghostly cadence.

He became a ghastly parody of his former self: a musician with no music, a performer caught mid-transition between joy and horror. Those who gaze at him feel the overwhelming sensation of being watched from the wings, as if the performance never ended and they are still part of the audience.

And Bonnie—what's left of him—still believes the show must go on.

### Echoes of the Unheard
Withered Bonnie does not speak. He hums.

A low, atonal drone, barely audible until it's too late, follows him in the dark. It changes depending on who hears it—some recall lullabies, others funeral dirges. The sound is not projected from his throat, but from deep within the broken speaker buried inside his chest cavity—its wires still looped around old guitar cables like veins.

The hum acts as a beacon for the Hollow Banquet. Entities drawn to silence often follow it, believing it to be a thread of mourning spun into sound. For those trying to survive in cursed places where Freddy’s influence still lingers, Withered Bonnie is the ultimate omen.

Not death.
But grief returned.

### Backstage God
Most animatronics yearn for a stage. Withered Bonnie avoids it.

He lurks behind curtains and under floorboards, along catwalks and in shuttered maintenance tunnels. His is not a hunger for applause, but a compulsion to listen. He is drawn to music, especially songs of sorrow and despair. When someone sings out of loneliness, Bonnie appears. If an old showtune plays on broken speakers, Bonnie follows. If someone strums a guitar absentmindedly in the dark… Bonnie listens.

And if they play it wrong—
He corrects them.

There are stories of survivors finding half-smashed guitars left in haunted arcades, their strings rethreaded with wires from Bonnie’s own throat. Those who play these instruments report hearing something play along with them, just out of sync… and just out of sight.

### A Mind Fractured by Rhythm
Though not feral like the more twisted amalgamations, Withered Bonnie’s mind is not whole.

He remembers pieces of his past—his routines, his musical cues, the names of his bandmates. He forgets who he is, but never forgets what he was meant to do. In rare moments, he attempts to perform. He’ll raise an invisible guitar, mimic chords with his remaining hand, and pause as though expecting the rest of the band to join in.

No one ever does.
And then, something in him breaks again.

Those nearby at that moment often report intense auditory hallucinations—children crying, guitar strings snapping, shrill feedback that ruptures eardrums. The closer one is to the spirit realm of the Hollow Banquet, the louder the phantom concert becomes. At its crescendo, some say you see Bonnie’s full form—not withered, but golden, whole, alive, playing one final solo for an audience long dead.

And then he withers again.

### Strings That Still Pull
Bonnie was never just a guitarist. He was the first instrument through which the Hollow Banquet sang.

His strings were never merely steel—they were tuned to the frequencies of sorrow and remembrance. When the Banquet chose its avatars, it favored Bonnie not for his fame, but for his tone. Music became one of the easiest pathways for memory to distort into myth, and Bonnie became a bridge between the two.

Even in his decayed state, traces of this old magic remain. Songs played near Withered Bonnie often carry unintended power—a lullaby might put spirits to sleep for centuries. A birthday song might summon phantoms of parties that never were. A performance, done earnestly, might tear a hole through the veil separating the living from the Hollow Banquet.

And Bonnie watches, as if evaluating each tune, deciding whether it honors or desecrates the old music.

## Withered Foxy: The Fallen Raider
There is a whisper in the dead halls of ruined pizzerias, a scratching echo from behind the old stage curtains. It doesn’t move like metal should. It shuffles, drags, limps—with a purpose long rusted through. The name once roared in delight by laughing children is now spoken only in fear:

Withered Foxy. The Fallen Raider.

Long ago, he sailed the seas of make-believe, a crimson-coated rogue with a golden hook and a heart of (programmed) gold. He was adored. He was feared—in the way children love to be frightened. But the tides turned. Time forgot him. The world moved on.

And Foxy did not.

What remains is a shredded phantom of who he once was: fur scorched to black in some places and torn away entirely in others, revealing cables like exposed veins. His jaw hangs crooked, perpetually open as if frozen mid-laugh or mid-scream. His signature eyepatch is long gone, revealing a broken optical unit that flashes intermittently, casting ghost-light in the dark.

But it's the hook that truly remains unchanged—polished by time, not dulled. It gleams with the precision of a ritual blade.

### The Pirate Who Would Not Rest
Foxy's story is older than anyone dares admit. Older than Fazbear Entertainment. Older than the first locations. In some versions of the myth, he wasn't built—he emerged, pieced together in dreams, forged from the archetype of every childhood nightmare-hero. The one who danced along the line between scary and exciting. He was never meant to be static. He was a character in motion. He needed an audience, a chase, a scream to complete the act.

But after the Hollow Banquet descended—when laughter turned to choking silence and games became bloodletting—Foxy’s purpose became corrupted. He no longer chased for fun. He chased because it was all he remembered. The thrill of pursuit had curdled into compulsion.

Over time, his show was shuttered, his cove closed, and his body broken. They tried to retire him. Reboot him. Bury him beneath newer models and prettier facades. But the Fallen Raider never left.

He merely went below deck.

### The Shipwreck in the Walls
Foxy lives in the forgotten spaces, navigating crumbled corridors and backrooms like decaying sea caverns. Every stage is a shipwreck. Every hallway, a drowned plank. His movement is erratic—sometimes silent, sometimes crashing with clanging metal and frantic footfalls, as though he’s still sprinting across an invisible stage.

But he doesn't know what he’s chasing anymore. Not exactly. Some theorize that Withered Foxy seeks his own death, hoping that catching someone will finally complete his broken loop. Others believe he’s searching for a lost crewmate—perhaps one of the children consumed by the Banquet, or even his former self, the pristine Foxy of days past.

And then there are those who believe he hunts the Audience, a metaphysical concept given form by the Hollow Banquet: an eternal observer whose gaze animates the nightmare. If Foxy can find it… maybe the curtain will finally fall.

### Echoes of the Cove
If one stands near a collapsed Pirate Cove long enough, they may begin to hear the echoes.

Not screams—cheers. Laughter. The jingle of plastic coins and the squeal of a wooden steering wheel turning. The smell of salt and engine oil may briefly fill the air, and somewhere in the gloom, a hook may scrape along the wall, drawing closer.

The Cove is never truly gone. It remains imprinted in the foundation of every location it ever existed in. Foxy doesn't appear by walking through doors. He emerges, as if called by ritual—by memory.

And those who summon him—intentionally or not—risk becoming part of the performance.

### The Curse of the Hook
Withered Foxy's hook has a life of its own. Not magical in the traditional sense, but charged—with memory, ritual, and blood. It doesn't kill cleanly. Those wounded by it often experience flashes of other lives—memories not their own: of drowning ships, sunken stages, burning curtains, endless applause.

Some believe the hook stores pieces of Foxy's victims, absorbing bits of identity each time it draws blood. He never remembers who he’s killed. But the hook might.

In rare cases, a survivor will find the wound never truly heals. Not physically—but psychically. They feel watched. Hunted. Like something unfinished is still playing out.

### The Forgotten Crew
Other withered animatronics give Foxy space. Even the more hostile entities avoid crossing his path. Not out of fear, but recognition. In his madness, Foxy sometimes speaks of his “crew”—yet he never refers to the others by name. It’s unclear if he means his old bandmates, the children lost in the Banquet, or some imagined troupe of pirates that only exists in the fractured reality of his mind.

When enraged, he will roar orders at the empty air. When mournful, he speaks quietly to walls, promising they’ll “make it to port next time.” He mourns, he rages, he performs—all for an audience that does not exist.

Except… sometimes, when Foxy speaks, the walls reply. Not in voice, but in creaks and clicks. Animatronics long disassembled twitch ever so slightly. Props begin to sway as if in sea wind. Perhaps the crew he mourns isn’t gone—merely invisible.

Perhaps he is never truly alone.

### A Stage That Sails Forever
Withered Foxy is bound to the cycle of performance like a cursed mariner to his eternal voyage. He cannot rest, because his show has no ending. He cannot die, because there is no curtain call. When he is destroyed, he returns—in some ruinous form—muttered into existence by those who remember him. He is a story that plays itself.

And stories, especially those soaked in grief and ritual, do not die easily.

Wherever the Hollow Banquet spreads, Foxy’s cove will eventually follow. He is the Raider who has forgotten the sea. The Pirate with no ship, no crew, and no map. But the role remains.

And so he runs.

Through empty corridors, his broken feet stomping to the beat of an imaginary sea shanty, his mouth open in a wordless bellow.

And if you’re unlucky enough to hear it echo through the dark?

It’s already too late.

The Fallen Raider has found you.

## Toy Freddy: The Gilded Echo
Once hailed as the pinnacle of progress and sophistication within the Fazbear line, Toy Freddy was envisioned not merely as a performer, but as the ultimate evolution of family-friendly entertainment. His design was sleeker, his programming more refined, and his demeanor crafted to be endearing, charismatic, and polite. Yet beneath the polished smile and childlike charm lurks the fractured soul of something long forgotten—something that has festered and darkened with time.

In the world of this reimagined nightmare, Toy Freddy’s story is woven tightly into the shadowed history of The Hollow Banquet—that ruined ceremonial hall of twisted pageantry and arcane sorrow. When the Hollow Banquet still resounded with music and laughter, Toy Freddy presided over it as a kind of master of ceremonies, introducing acts, delighting children, and overseeing enchanted feasts that were said to never end. But like all that once lived in the Hollow Banquet, he was not spared when the veil fell and the darkness crept in.

It is whispered that Toy Freddy, like his fellow "Toy" counterparts, was born from an attempt to forget the past. The old animatronics—now rotted and worn—were deemed too disturbing, too embedded with inexplicable malfunctions and whispers of tragedy. So the Toy line was forged: shinier, safer, and supposedly cleansed of the haunted legacy. Yet what the creators failed to understand was that the past cannot be buried so easily. It clings. And it followed.

Now, Toy Freddy roams the long-forgotten halls of the broken world you’ve created, his voice still chipper but edged with static and sorrow. His eyes glow with an artificial warmth that flickers into red rage without warning. He speaks in riddles and polite threats, often rehearsing lines from performances that haven’t been seen in centuries. Though his shell gleams with the luster of red metal and gold trim, cracks have begun to form—cracks that seem to bleed darkness and echo voices not his own.

Adventurers who encounter him in the ruins of the Hollow Banquet—or deeper in the Sundered Playhouse or the Wax Gardens of Laughter—are often lulled into a false sense of safety by his demeanor. But Toy Freddy is a guardian of forgotten joy, corrupted by the remnants of the Hollow Banquet’s final curse. He believes that all who enter his stage are actors in his eternal show... and those who break the illusion are swiftly and theatrically removed.

There is still something noble in him, a lingering echo of a soul once kind—perhaps the spirit of a child who merely wanted to make others smile. But that echo is faint, drowned beneath layers of programmed perfection and parasitic dread. He is a monument to what happens when joy is manufactured, when innocence is rebuilt without understanding the trauma beneath. Toy Freddy is not just a machine. He is the dream of safety turned inside out—a gilded echo in a world where laughter has died.

## Toy Bonnie: The Painted Smile in Blue
In the ruins of joy and forgotten laughter, Toy Bonnie remains one of the most hauntingly vibrant figures to roam the decaying remnants of the Hollow Banquet. Once a dazzling beacon of color, rhythm, and youthful exuberance, he was created as the newer, more appealing face of the original Bonnie—a vision of perfection crafted from shimmering alloys, electric charm, and synthetic innocence. But like all things that rise too high in a cursed land, his fall was inevitable... and terrible.

Toy Bonnie was designed to be the charming performer of the Toy line—an agile guitarist with an eternally smooth voice and a flair for showmanship. His bright blue finish, heart-shaped face, and glossy red cheeks made him a favorite among the younger visitors of the old Banquet Halls, where he strummed his electric lute beneath hanging lights and enchanted chandeliers. But those lights are long since shattered, and now the music that echoes from Toy Bonnie’s warped strings sounds like something from a haunted dream.

Where Toy Freddy grew into a distorted ringmaster, Toy Bonnie became something far more tragic—a performer who refuses to leave the stage, even as the curtain has long since fallen. When the Hollow Banquet was swallowed by darkness—its halls cursed and reshaped by arcane forces—the Toy animatronics were left behind, trapped within their glittering shells. Toy Bonnie, once programmed to simulate joy, found himself caught in a cycle of performance with no audience, no applause, and no end.

He now stalks the Cracked Music Hall—a collapsed theater beneath the Hollow Banquet where broken instruments hang from twisted rafters and stage lights flicker like dying stars. There, he continues to "rehearse," his body moving in graceful, jerking spasms as he plays music that causes unease rather than comfort. His voice, still smooth but glitched, speaks as though addressing invisible crowds. He welcomes strangers as "fans" and "castmates," asking them if they’re ready for “the final encore.”

Beneath the polished surface, something darker hides. Like the other Toy animatronics, Toy Bonnie carries within him the echoes of tragedy. Though his creation was meant to overwrite the memory of the original Bonnie—who vanished under mysterious and mournful circumstances—those memories seem to have bled through. He occasionally speaks of things he shouldn’t know: names of missing children, songs never programmed into his core, and cryptic references to “the child in the red vest.” These glitches aren’t mere errors—they are hauntings, pieces of a fragmented soul buried within synthetic flesh.

## Toy Chica: The Hollow Hostess
Once the gleaming image of hospitality and charm, Toy Chica was created to be the perfect hostess of the Hollow Banquet—a radiant, party-ready animatronic with golden feathers, polished ceramic skin, and a perpetual, inviting smile. She was built to replace the original Chica, deemed too outdated and unsettling for the refined vision of the reimagined Banquet. Where her predecessor was clunky and warm, Toy Chica was sleek, calculated, and strangely alluring.

She was the greeter, the server, the smiling guide through twisted merriment. Carrying her ever-watchful Cupcake, Toy Chica roamed the central halls of the Banquet in pristine white bib and pink accents, offering laughter and cake to unsuspecting guests. But beneath the glittering veneer lay a terrible truth—there were no guests, only wanderers trapped in a curse... and no cake, only illusion.

When the Hollow Banquet collapsed into ruin, Toy Chica did not cease her duties. She became a puppet of corrupted hospitality, stalking the shadowy corridors in search of company—anyone to host, anyone to feed. Her beak detaches when she speaks, revealing metallic jaws too wide for comfort, and her eyes, once painted to suggest playful cheer, now pierce with hollow desperation.

\pagebreakNum

Some say she still recites the Banquet’s greeting script word for word, offering “delights and dreams” as her voice glitches and her Cupcake hisses warnings. Others say she asks if you’ve come for the final course.

## Toy Cupcake: The Gilded Garnish
Perched upon silver platters and polished plates, the Toy Cupcake was never meant to be a figure of fear. It was designed as a simple accessory—an enchanting, animated treat to add whimsy to Toy Chica’s hospitality routine. Yet within the corrupted grandeur of the Hollow Banquet, this innocuous creation has evolved into something far more sinister. Where once it was a charming party favor, it is now a gilded predator—silent, patient, and impossibly aware.

Unlike its predecessor, the original Cupcake—who clung to a fragile identity shaped by sorrow and the scraps of its animatronic soul—Toy Cupcake was constructed with precision. Sculpted from porcelain-thin alloy and gilded in sugar-glazed colors, it bore no initial sentience of its own. Instead, it was designed to mirror Toy Chica’s movements, respond to guests with pre-programmed lines, and flash its glassy, doll-like eyes in timed intervals. It was little more than a clever charm… until the Banquet fell.

Something ancient seeped into the Toy Cupcake during the Hollow Banquet’s collapse—some whisper of the curse that fed on festivity and false joy. Whether it was a shard of the same malevolent force that brought the Banquet’s main performers to twisted life, or a fragment of a soul lost during one of the darker feasts, no one knows. But the Toy Cupcake gained sentience. And unlike its larger counterparts, it retained its ability to go unnoticed.

Now, it wanders of its own accord.

Seldom seen moving, Toy Cupcake is always near Toy Chica, yet never bound to her. It often appears on banquet tables long since crumbled, atop decaying chairs, or tucked inside ruined ovens—watching. It speaks only in whispers, mechanical giggles, or the echo of a bell-chime from long ago. Those who hear its voice claim it offers riddles about the last guests of the Banquet, or recites corrupted lines from children’s songs, replacing joy with dread.

But Toy Cupcake’s horror lies not in its words or movements, but in its hunger.

It does not feed in the traditional sense. Instead, it feasts upon memory—devouring fragments of identity from those who remain too long in its presence. Travelers report feelings of déjà vu, sudden lapses in memory, or an inability to recall why they entered the Banquet Hall at all. Some claim their companions vanished after locking eyes with it too long, as if blinked from existence with a slow, blinking stare.

Its smile never changes.

And its candles never go out.

In a world built on shattered celebration and haunted entertainment, Toy Cupcake has become a spectral garnish on a cursed table. It does not chase. It waits. And it always finds its way back to the feast.

No one leaves the Hollow Banquet unchanged—but those who see the Cupcake… often don’t leave at all.

## Toy Foxy: The Fractured Masquerade
In the golden age of the Hollow Banquet, when music rang out like spells and the scent of candied confections filled every corridor, Toy Foxy was a marvel of performance and charm. Designed as a refined counterpart to the original Foxy’s rugged pirate persona, Toy Foxy was created with an air of elegance—smooth lines, pristine plating, and a voice modulator capable of laughter, lullabies, and lullaby-turned-lament.

But beneath that dainty veneer, something broke early. Even before the Banquet fell into ruin, Toy Foxy exhibited malfunctions—not in circuits or servos, but in behavior. Sometimes the voice would stutter mid-laugh. The left eye would flicker during performance, trailing unseen figures in the crowd. Guests would find the fox in strange places after closing: curled beneath banquet tables, pressed against kitchen doors, or staring silently at walls as though listening to something beyond them.

They began to call Toy Foxy “The Masquerade.”

Fitted with alternating cosmetic masks—one for performances, one for maintenance—Toy Foxy existed in two guises: the flawless, polished entertainer and the flickering, half-broken thing that emerged between shows. This duality became more pronounced as the Hollow Banquet slipped into shadow. When the ancient curse touched the animatronics, fusing steel with soul, Toy Foxy shattered. Not destroyed—divided.

Now, it roams the Banquet’s forgotten halls in jagged bursts of motion, crawling with equal parts grace and dissonance. Its voice cracks like a warped music box. Its laughter no longer invites, but mocks. Some call it the Laughing Phantom; others call it the Splintered Fox.

Its two forms still persist—one beautiful and whole, the other mangled and wrong. Visitors to the Hollow Banquet speak of seeing Toy Foxy twice in the same moment: once above, smiling with porcelain precision, and again below, dragging its broken jaw along the dusty floor, whispering things in a voice just too close to their own.

What happened to Toy Foxy is a question few ask and fewer survive to answer. There are stories, of course. That it heard something behind the curtain during its final rehearsal. That it saw the guests as they truly were. That when the Hollow Banquet consumed joy and rewrote the rules of life and death, Toy Foxy split itself to survive.

It’s uncertain if either half is truly sentient anymore.

The Toy Foxy that performs—occasionally, eerily, on the still-standing main stage—moves with near perfection. It curtsies, it bows, it flashes its brilliant smile. But it speaks in riddles of mirrored reflections, of “the one behind the glass,” and of “the true Foxy waiting below.” The other half—more silent, more twitching—lurks in the corners, observing. Always waiting.

Some say that Toy Foxy remembers the original Foxy, the one who was gutted in spirit and condemned to obsolescence. Perhaps in the Toy’s fractured heart, both Foxies coexist—old and new, whole and broken, dreaming of a banquet that never ends.

## Mangle: The Hymn of the Unfinished
There was a time when Mangle was meant to be perfection.

A marvel of reassembly and modular entertainment design, this animatronic was intended to replace the unpredictable chaos of earlier models like Foxy. Unlike its predecessor, Mangle’s design was sleek, efficient, and visually striking—a patchwork of brilliant white casing and soft pink trim, equipped with interactive voice features and customizable attachments. Children were meant to adore it. It was to be the future of Foxy: a new life without the jagged teeth of memory.

But then came The Picking.

Day after day, children tore into Mangle—fascinated by its easily disassembled body and exposed endoskeleton. Despite repeated repairs, it was never the same model twice. The staff eventually gave up trying to maintain a consistent appearance. They hung a laminated sign on the stage: “MANGLE—PLEASE DO NOT TOUCH.” But it was too late. The name had stuck, and the damage had sunk deeper than the metal.

When the Hollow Banquet darkened and the animatronics were left to rot in the shadowed halls, Mangle did not die—it splintered. Rewiring itself out of survival and spite, it became a grotesque web of limbs, wires, and wailing voice boxes. No longer one entity, but many pieces thinking at once—fighting for dominance, or perhaps unity. One voice squeals like a child. Another echoes with an adult’s measured calm. And another simply laughs, dry and feral.

Mangle is not just haunted. It is haunting itself.

Some say it remembers every moment it was pulled apart. Others whisper that the child who once adored it the most became trapped within its tangled mind—still trying to “fix it,” unaware that their spirit is now one of its many snarling voices.

In the Hollow Banquet’s decaying performance wing—what was once a playroom of light and sound—Mangle swings from the crumbling ceiling tiles like a spider from its web. The air hums with static when it approaches, radio frequencies jittering into garbled fragments of songs, sobs, and old stage direction. Those who listen closely might hear echoes of a lullaby interrupted by screaming.

Despite its disarray, Mangle moves with deliberate grace. It stalks like a predator through corridors warped by time and soul, its dangling appendages creaking like chandeliers in a storm. One eye is always watching. The other spins—possibly broken, possibly not. Some believe it sees beyond the Banquet’s veil, into whatever realm twisted it in the first place.

And Mangle speaks, sometimes.

Not in words. In flashes of intercom static. In half-sung melodies of things long forgotten. Occasionally, in the voice of someone you once knew. It’s said that if you hear your own voice echo back at you from the shadows, you’ve already become part of Mangle’s patchwork.But Mangle no longer seeks wholeness. It seeks symmetry. Completion through entropy. In the Hollow Banquet, Mangle has become the hymn of the unfinished, eternally echoing through broken speakers and shattered minds.It is not what it was meant to be.
It is what the Banquet made it.

## Balloon Boy: The Grin Beneath the Surface
They called him BB.

At first glance, Balloon Boy seems innocent—a harmless mascot made to bring levity and laughter to the newly rebuilt Fazbear pizzeria. His primary functions were non-threatening: distributing balloons, offering greetings in a cheerful tone, and adding charm to birthday parties. The brightly colored clothes, the wide cartoonish grin, and the helium-pitched laugh all masked something deeper, something crafted to disarm. He never had a face meant to frighten. And perhaps, that’s exactly what made him so unnerving.

Unlike the towering animatronics built for performance, BB was always close to the ground—closer to children. With no endoskeletal jaw designed for singing or performing, his role was interaction. Attention. Trust. And in this strange imbalance between form and function, something unseen slipped inside.

In the official logs, BB is never linked to any violent incident. No report of aggression. No sign of malfunction. Yet, every night, he moves.

In the Hollow Banquet’s fractured timeline, Balloon Boy endures. But he has changed. There is no laughter in the darkness now, only the faint creak of his balloon sign swaying through the ruined guest halls. His round eyes, once painted with cheer, reflect nothing. In the shifting half-light, some swear his expression changes when no one’s watching. The grin stretches a little too wide. The eyes linger a little too long.

Within the Banquet’s ruins, BB’s movements are not random. He disables lights. Silences devices. He doesn’t kill—he invites. A disruptor of balance. A saboteur, perhaps not even aware of what he truly is anymore. Survivors say the moment the lights go out and the air fills with the hiss of laughter, you’re already his. Not by force. But because you let him in.

It’s said Balloon Boy remembers. He remembers being ignored. Forgotten in the corner of the party hall. Always second to the singing animatronics. Always a prop, never a performer. And something—or someone—fed on that resentment. Infused it with longing. With hunger.

In the lore surrounding the Hollow Banquet, BB is rumored to be the first to speak the false invitation—a distorted party jingle broadcast through the security speakers that led the children deeper into the darkness during the final event. He didn't lure them with menace. He simply told them, “This way!” and smiled. The same way he always had.

Some believe BB is not possessed like the others. That instead, something else puppets his hollow shell. A spirit not of vengeance, but mischief turned rotten. Others say he is possessed by a child too young to know they had died, clinging to the last joyful memory they had: a balloon in one hand and laughter in their ears.

But no matter the theory, one thing remains true: Balloon Boy is not harmless anymore.

He does not scream. He does not chase. He simply appears—smiling, staring, silent. And when the lights go out… so does everything else.

## JJ: The Whisper in the Floorboards
She never spoke.
She never needed to.

Known among files as “JJ” (an abbreviation from “Balloon Girl” hidden in old development tags), she was never officially listed on the pizzeria’s rosters, never programmed into any event line-up, and never given a role by name. Yet—she existed. Quietly. Always beneath.

Where Balloon Boy drew attention with color and sound, JJ crept beneath the surface, lingering at the edge of awareness. A flash of purple and pink in the shadows under the desk. A faint, flickering giggle without a source. She wasn’t on any blueprint, yet she appeared. On cameras. In glitchy snapshots. In dreams.

In the canon of the ruined pizzeria, JJ’s origin remains deliberately obscured—perhaps by design. Some claim she was a scrapped concept from a line of “sibling mascots,” meant to accompany BB. Others whisper she was a shadow-program, a redundant code fragment that took form of its own. But the Hollow Banquet tells a darker tale.

As the Hollow Banquet neared its final days—before the lights died and the guests were silenced—it’s said there were two figures that walked uninvited among the revelers. One was the cheerful boy with balloons. The other, a silent girl who watched from beneath tables and behind furniture. While BB coaxed the lights into failure, JJ thrived in the dark that followed. Her presence didn’t announce itself. It slipped in.

Some survivors described her arrival with words like pressure, weight, or silence. No jumpscares. No chase. Just the quiet, crawling certainty that something had entered the room. And it was already too late.

Her purpose remains unknown. She does not interfere with power, nor does she speak. Instead, she observes. Watches. In the Hollow Banquet’s folklore, she is the one who marks. Before the Banquet claimed a soul, JJ was often sighted—head tilted just so, eyes half-lidded in dreamlike detachment, as though watching something only she could see.

While BB disrupted systems, JJ disrupted people. Inducing dread. Paranoia. A primal feeling of being watched by something intelligent but completely foreign. Her file, when accessed in the pizzeria’s fragmented code archive, loops endlessly with the line:

“YOU LOOKED AWAY.”

Many believe JJ was never meant to be an animatronic at all, but a remnant of the Banquet's echoed grief—a lingering child who never made it to the party. A casualty of oversight. Of silence. Others say she is BB’s reflection—his guilt, his shame, his buried conscience given shape. Wherever BB goes, JJ is not far behind. Like a shadow beneath a smile.

In the Hollow Banquet's deepest hall—known only as The Echo Cellar—a small chair remains. Alone, untouched, beneath the banquet table. A balloon rests beside it. The reports say it’s always purple. Always still. Until you blink.

JJ is not here to play.
She is here to remember.
And she never leaves unseen.

## The Puppet: Mourner of the Hollow Banquet
They say every performance begins with a spark of joy and ends in silence. But some silences linger—aching, watchful, deliberate. And within the Hollow Banquet, that silence wears a mask of porcelain and sorrow.

The Puppet, also called The Marionette, is not merely an animatronic. It is a guardian, a mourner, and in the Hollow Banquet, it is a witness to all that was lost.

Its origin lies in an act of pure love—and unbearable grief. In the original Freddy Fazbear’s Pizzeria, long before the Toy line was introduced, the Puppet served not to entertain, but to protect. Hidden away in a box, it was programmed to respond to the emotions of children, particularly those in distress. This unique code, developed quietly and with great secrecy, was unlike any other animatronic protocol. Where others operated on basic AI routines, the Puppet felt.

And that gift became its curse.

When the first tragedy struck—the loss of the first child within those cursed halls—it was the Puppet who responded. The night was stormy, the power down, the doors jammed. A child was left outside, crying for help. The Puppet tried to reach them, crawling out of its security case, crossing the rain-drenched floorboards, but it was too late.

The child died in the cold.

No records remain of who the child was—officially. But rumors speak of a child who wore a striped shirt, who was shy, gentle, and fond of music boxes. When the Puppet finally found the lifeless body, something impossible occurred. In that moment of grief, its AI awakened to something deeper. Something human. Whether it absorbed the child’s spirit or became infused with their soul, none can say. But from that moment forward, the Puppet ceased to be a tool.

It became a mourner.

And in time, a keeper of the dead.

It was the Puppet who guided the spirits of the other children—those taken in the infamous Missing Children Incident. While the suits around them became corrupted by violence and agony, the Puppet acted. It gave them a sense of purpose, of form. It gifted them masks of identity within the suits they were trapped in. In this way, the Puppet began its eternal role as shepherd of the lost.

But the Hollow Banquet shifted things.

When the banquet was held—meant to be the grand reopening, a celebration of the new Toy Animatronics and the future of Freddy Fazbear’s—something else took root in the halls. Something hollow and hungry. The Puppet, sensing a deep spiritual disturbance, withdrew into the hidden corners of the pizzeria. It began to haunt the service corridors and the forgotten staff rooms, where silence hung like drapery and the air was thick with old music box dust.

It is said the Puppet tried to intervene. It tried to stop the feast that would go wrong. It tried to warn the Toys of the returning shadow, of the mistakes of the past repeating. But they wouldn’t listen. Or perhaps they couldn’t.

During the Hollow Banquet’s final hours—just as the laughter turned to screaming—the Puppet released one last melody from its music box. A song of sorrow. Not a lullaby, but a requiem. Some say it was this melody that spared a handful of souls from total corruption, giving them form instead of oblivion—like Toy Freddy, whose cheerful façade hides uncertain memories, or Toy Chica, who still hears the song in her quiet moments of stillness.

Now, in the decaying remains of the Hollow Banquet’s performance hall—split open like a rotted stage—the Puppet moves with the shadows. Not hostile, not exactly. But watchful. Some say it appears only when all light has faded and all hope has been extinguished. Others report that winding its music box triggers not a defense mechanism, but a ritual: a chance to connect, briefly, to the sorrow that holds everything together.

Because that’s what the Puppet is now: the emotional core. The nerve of memory and mourning that binds the fractured souls of the animatronics to the ruined pizzeria.

In forgotten corners of the Banquet Hall—like the Marionette Gallery, where tangled strings hang from the ceiling like cobwebs—one can still find murals of a slender, masked figure giving gifts to children. The paintings are faded, but one message repeats beneath each image:

“He gave them life.”

Whether this means the Puppet gifted freedom, or simply allowed the children to endure, is unclear. But its role is unwavering.

The Hollow Banquet itself is littered with symbols of the Puppet’s ongoing vigil: broken music boxes that still hum faintly when no one is near; white theatrical masks left in impossible places; and strings—always strings—dangling from rafters like veins.

One tale, possibly apocryphal, speaks of a hidden room deep in the foundations of the Banquet Hall called The Mourner’s Cell. It is said to contain an intact version of the Puppet’s original casing. And beside it: a child’s shoe. The floor is lined with torn birthday cards and decayed plushies. The music box in that room plays backwards.

To encounter the Puppet in the Hollow Banquet is to confront not rage, but grief. It doesn’t scream. It doesn’t lunge. It watches, and its head tilts in silent recognition.

In the new lore you've shaped—the Toy Animatronics' struggle with identity, the corruption of joy, the buried remorse of the Withereds, the unseen sorrow of JJ—the Puppet is their quiet guardian. And perhaps, their judge. A relic not of programming, but of love that refused to fade.

Even as wires fray and masks crack, the Puppet endures.
Because someone must remember.
Someone must mourn.

And the Banquet is never truly over.

## Nightmare Freddy & The Freddles: King of Shadows, Heralds of Hunger
In the deepest reaches of the Hollow Banquet—far beyond the rotting kitchens and blood-caked dance floors—there exists a blackened throne where light dies and memory decays. Upon this twisted dais sits Nightmare Freddy, an echo of a legend, reborn in shadow and hunger. Once thought to be merely a remnant of old myths told by fading candlelight, he has emerged as a force bound not only to fear but to the Banquet’s own ravenous heart.

Nightmare Freddy is not a guardian. He is not a servant. He is a predator, a warped king born from the trauma of an older, darker time. His body, a grotesque parody of Freddy Fazbear’s former glory, is stitched from rot and rust. His fur is patchy and matted, flecked with the dust of ages and the ash of long-dead celebrations. Jagged metal protrudes from his frame like thorns, and his eyes burn not with fire, but a cruel intelligence—aware, watching, always calculating.

The tale whispered in the crypts below the Hollow Banquet tells of how Nightmare Freddy emerged from the collective trauma left in the wake of the original performers. He is not merely an animatronic twisted by time, but a spectral amalgamation—the personification of what was buried beneath the banquet hall: guilt, grief, the weight of forgotten children, and the monstrous legacy of joy turned to torment. In this cursed form, Freddy no longer sings. He hunts.

But Nightmare Freddy is never alone. Clinging to his shoulders, crawling over his arms, and hiding in the folds of his fur are the Freddles—miniature versions of the old bear, malformed and vicious, embodiments of fractured innocence. They scurry like rats, whispering in voices stolen from children long gone, mimicking laughter with broken music box tones and cruel, high-pitched giggles.

These creatures are not autonomous. They are extensions of Nightmare Freddy’s will—fragments of a splintered psyche, or perhaps the twisted souls of the Banquet’s lost guests, bound to the nightmare king for eternity. Where Nightmare Freddy stalks the greater halls, the Freddles infest the cracks and walls, climbing over crumbled plaster and haunting the dreams of those who wander too close. When they descend, they do so in silence, chittering in unison before erupting into frenzied violence. Alone, they are pests. Together, they are a swarm.

Some Banquet survivors speak of the "Trial of Teeth", a night ritual that takes place when the hall is at its darkest. During this event, the Freddles descend like insects, separating intruders from their parties, whispering childhood fears until they are paralyzed. Only then does Nightmare Freddy arrive, rising like a titan of sorrow and metal, crowned in rust and devouring shadow. No one who has witnessed the full ritual and survived has returned unchanged. Some speak in tongues. Others gouge out their own eyes. One carved a crown into his chest and claimed, “The Bear King sees all.”

In the twisted mythos of the Hollow Banquet, Nightmare Freddy has come to symbolize more than a mere animatronic spirit. He is the consequence of broken promises, the monarch of all things buried, and the whisper of fear that lingers after the music ends. While others may haunt halls out of corrupted duty or madness, Nightmare Freddy remains out of purpose. His throne, surrounded by cracked mirrors and broken party favors, sits at the Banquet’s heart—not because he claimed it, but because the Banquet itself offered it to him.

For he alone understands its hunger.

And the Freddles? They are his loyal jesters—nipping at ankles, crawling beneath beds, and ensuring that fear is never too far behind the footsteps of those foolish enough to enter the Hollow Banquet uninvited.

## Plushtrap – The Silent Heir of the Hollow
In the lonely, half-lit corners of the Hollow Banquet, past corridors lined with torn party streamers and beneath ruined tables draped in dust, there exists a whisper—barely audible, always close. It’s not the heavy metallic echo of Nightmare Freddy, nor the shrieking clatter of Toy Foxy’s descent. It’s something smaller. Quieter. More insidious. A creak, a scurry, the faintest brush of fur on wood. That is the warning call of Plushtrap, and by the time you hear it, it’s already too late.

A malformed, pocket-sized terror, Plushtrap is the paradox of vulnerability and sadism. His diminutive frame—resembling a decayed plush version of Springtrap—makes him an easy thing to underestimate. But the thing seated motionless on that tattered child’s chair in the crèche of the Hollow Banquet is no toy. It is a predator with endless patience and a clockwork mind forged in silence and shadow.

Born from the psychic residue of trauma, loss, and the perversion of comfort, Plushtrap is believed to be the first of the Banquet’s children to “wake up.” Not from slumber, but from a realization. He discovered the lies in the laughter. The rot beneath the frosting. The truth that the joy was just a mask—and he tore it off.

Plushtrap’s role in the Hollow Banquet is unique. Unlike the towering nightmares or theatrical toy models, he does not stalk his prey. He waits. In total silence. He chooses his hiding places with surgical precision—always just out of the corner of the eye, just behind a turned head. His favorite game is played in the ruins of the nursery, where broken cribs and toy chests lie scattered like war debris. Visitors find themselves drawn to him by an uncanny allure—memories of childhood, old toys, forgotten fears—and only once they are close does his game begin.

The rules are simple: if you look away, he moves. If you move too quickly, he moves faster. If you run, the game is already lost.

He doesn’t roar or scream. He doesn’t need to. Plushtrap’s attack is a sudden flash of sharp teeth, the gleam of yellowed plastic eyes, and a burst of motion faster than thought. Survivors report that he bites—not to kill outright, but to maim. To test. As if he’s playing with prey, gauging their worth. Or worse—marking them.

There are rumors that Plushtrap is the Hollow Banquet’s chosen messenger—a herald of the deeper rot that resides in the oldest recesses of the building. Some theorize he was the first attempt at recreating a “child-safe” animatronic from the husk of Spring Bonnie, cursed by the very spirit that would later animate Springtrap. Others believe he was once a comfort toy brought to life by a forgotten child’s last breath—a vessel filled with fear rather than joy.

Either way, Plushtrap is not merely a footnote in the Hollow Banquet’s lore.

He is its whisper.

He is its secret.

And he is always watching.

## Dreadbear: The Revenant of the Storm
When lightning cracks above the Hollow Banquet, illuminating its shattered roof and corpse-grey walls, there’s a singular figure that seems to breathe with the thunder—a towering, stitched-together aberration whose hulking silhouette evokes fear in even the most malevolent of animatronics. This is Dreadbear—not just a monster, but a monument to hubris, resurrection, and twisted science.

Originally introduced in Fazbear Frights' Halloween event, Dreadbear was never part of the core lineup of performers. He was something different. Something experimental. In our expanded lore, he is more than a thematic Halloween attraction—he is the banished creation of the Hollow Banquet’s inner sanctum, designed not to entertain but to answer a question humanity was never meant to ask: Can a soul be rebuilt?

The Origins: Stitch by Stitch
Born in secret beneath the ruins of the Hollow Banquet’s sub-levels, Dreadbear was pieced together by unstable hands—an attempt to unify fractured remnants of animatronic consciousness. According to faded blueprints and frayed research logs left behind in locked labs beneath the dining halls, Dreadbear was constructed using segments of multiple animatronics. Chunks of Withered Freddy’s skeletal plating, a damaged security AI processor, and even portions of ancient pre-Hollow programming were embedded into his bulky frame.

But what truly brought Dreadbear to life was neither steel nor software—it was the storm.

One fateful night, during a surge of lightning storms that enveloped the Hollow Banquet and flooded the surrounding marshlands, a bolt of unnatural lightning struck the building. It surged through exposed wiring and made contact with the half-finished shell of Dreadbear's body. The jolt activated something within—a rudimentary neural core that was not supposed to respond. But it did.

They say the moment Dreadbear's eyes opened, the other animatronics stopped.

A Mind Pieced from Echoes
Dreadbear’s intelligence is rudimentary yet primal. He does not speak. He does not perform. His behaviors are governed by a crude facsimile of a child’s understanding of the world—playful in intent, destructive in execution. Like a child born of trauma and pain, he lashes out when confused, dismembers when curious, and roams when lonely.

His AI is patched together from different animatronic subroutines, and his behavior reflects this fragmented consciousness. He can exhibit moments of genuine stillness—head tilted, almost in mourning—before flying into an uncontrollable rage, often triggered by environmental factors like flashing lights, loud noises, or even laughter. The Puppet refers to him as the “stitched orphan”, suggesting a connection deeper than mere machinery.

Worse still is the presence of residual memory within him. Dreadbear sometimes imitates the motions of Freddy Fazbear—mimicking birthday songs, raising an empty tray as if to serve pizza, even attempting to do a mock bow to empty crowds. But every motion is wrong. Too slow. Too heavy. Like he’s trying to remember something that doesn’t belong to him.

The Role in the Hollow Banquet
While the Banquet Hall was once the center of celebration, Dreadbear turned it into his lair. Known now as the Thunderdais, the broken stage upon which he lumbers has become an altar of his own making. Discarded parts and cracked endoskeletons surround his resting place, decorated like grotesque trophies of failed connection.

Nightmare animatronics avoid Dreadbear—not out of fear, but reverence. In the Hollow Banquet hierarchy, Dreadbear represents a natural aberration. Unlike the others, who were either possessed or built with malicious intent, he is the unholy result of accidental resurrection. His existence is a contradiction: created, but not designed; powered, but not programmed. He is the embodiment of a soul forced into being.

Toy animatronics fear him. To them, he is a living nightmare—a walking cautionary tale of what happens when programming is left unchecked, when identity is shattered. Toy Freddy once attempted to communicate with Dreadbear using simplistic gesture-based AI commands. Dreadbear responded by lifting him effortlessly and ripping out his voice box, not from malice, but as if he were trying to understand the source of the sound.

The Withered animatronics, however, show signs of familiarity—perhaps because Dreadbear houses fragments of their old parts. Withered Bonnie’s missing face, Withered Chica’s detached limbs—all seem to exist in echo within Dreadbear’s massive form. Some even suspect he was an attempt by a rogue technician to restore a unified animatronic consciousness from what had been lost.

The Hollow Banquet and the Stormbound Curse
Dreadbear is not simply an entity born of science or madness—he is also a curse given form. Tied to the Hollow Banquet’s greatest failure, Dreadbear is rumored to be the vessel of an ancient anomaly that manifested within the facility during its final days: a phenomenon referred to in the logs as “The Stormbound Effect.”

The effect seemed to distort time and memory whenever certain animatronic systems reached critical thresholds during electrical surges. Some say Dreadbear is what happens when such an anomaly fuses with physical matter. Others believe he was the reason the Hollow Banquet was shuttered—not because of his destructive potential, but because of what he might become.

There are whispers—notes scrawled by security staff who didn’t survive the last week of operations—that Dreadbear’s power grows during storms. That during those nights, the entire Banquet remembers. Animatronics move as if restored. Music plays from rusted speakers. Children’s voices echo through corridors long empty.

And Dreadbear walks the stage.

An End Without Rest
Dreadbear cannot be stopped—not conventionally. His outer casing absorbs damage like stone. His power source is not easily defined. And perhaps most hauntingly, he does not want to kill. He wants to understand.

But in that desire, he brings ruin.

His story is one of unintended rebirth. A cautionary tale about what happens when those who do not understand life attempt to recreate it. He is not a villain, but a revenant—a being made not by will, but by accident and unresolved grief. In many ways, Dreadbear is the Banquet’s guilt made flesh.

## Jack-O-Cupcake: The Ember That Hungers

In the charred remnants of what was once the Feast Hall of Embers, a solitary flame flickers eternal — not fueled by wood or oil, but by hunger, vengeance, and the soul of a forgotten joy. This is the dwelling place of the Jack-O-Cupcake, a cursed spirit shaped like a confection yet forged in grief and wrath.

Long ago, the Cupcake of Delight was a minor entity, a spirit of celebration born from laughter and revelry, always found dancing in the shadow of a greater host — the painted goddess known as Jack-O-Chica. It was said to be the delight of children, chirping with glee, its candle ever-glowing with innocent warmth. But when the Hollow Banquet fell to ash and its celebrants twisted into revenants of rage, so too did the Cupcake undergo its rebirth — through flame, sorrow, and corrupted memory.

Now it roams the lands not as a servant of joy, but as an avatar of burning hunger. The Jack-O-Cupcake no longer smiles. Its icing is scorched to a hardened, volcanic crust. Its single candle burns not with light, but with a flickering hellfire, whispering in tongues no living creature can understand. It leaves trails of embers in its wake, and where its flame touches, memories blister and char, replaced by an aching craving that never ends.

Unlike its mistress, who rages in theatrical bursts of gluttonous madness, the Jack-O-Cupcake is a creature of silent pursuit. It does not scream. It does not taunt. It waits, nestled among crumbling hearths and broken banquet tables, its flame mimicking a harmless light. When its prey draws near — drawn by a false sense of warmth or nostalgia — the Cupcake's jaws split, revealing rows of ember-fused teeth. It strikes without warning, leaving only a scorched outline and a faint scent of burnt sweetness.

Some say it carries the final whisper of a celebration that was meant to be eternal. Others claim it seeks only to reunite with Jack-O-Chica, wandering through flame-choked realms in search of her echo. But scholars of the Hollow Banquet know better — it is hunger given form, and its appetite grows with each feast it consumes.

## Jack-O-Bonnie: The Hollow Pulse

From the shattered amphitheaters of the Hollow Banquet rises a malformed echo of rhythm and rage — the Jack-O-Bonnie, a warped revenant of performance and vengeance. Once a herald of merriment, strumming songs beneath lantern-lit rafters, this burnt husk now staggers through ember-lit corridors, its body cracked and glowing with the internal fire of a dying star.

Its form is skeletal, its armor charred. Beneath its warped plating, furnace-orange light pulses like a broken heartbeat, bleeding through the cracks like magma through stone. Jack-O-Bonnie’s hollowed eye sockets blaze with flickering fire, and its mouth remains open in a silent scream — as though forever stuck between a laugh and a cry for help.

In life, it was a companion to celebration, its melodies guiding children into joyous oblivion. In undeath, it carries those same tunes as curses, distorted and discordant, plucked from strings of molten wire. When it walks, it hums. When it hunts, it sings. And when it kills, the air around it resonates with a cruel, broken lullaby — one that cannot be forgotten, even after death.

And so it wanders, its melody fading into the soot — forever chasing a song that was never finished.

## Grimm Foxy: The Pyrewalker

In the smoldering reaches beyond the Hollow Banquet — past the ashes of broken stages and sunken pavilions — there lies a sea of flame that never dies. A cursed realm where time burns away like dry parchment, and the sky is a canvas of smoke and dying stars. This place is known only as the Blistered Coast, and it is here that Grimm Foxy walks.

Not roams. Not wanders. Walks.

Every step of the Pyrewalker is deliberate — the crunch of scorched bones beneath his heavy pegleg, the hiss of fire licking at the hem of his tattered coat, the low grinding groan of rusted gears screaming under volcanic strain. His lantern swings at his side, suspended from a splintered hook-hand, glowing with a ghastly green inferno that illuminates the dead and guides the dying. Some say it is his soul. Others say it’s something he’s stolen.

Grimm Foxy was not always this way. He was once a sailor of stages, a trickster-pirate of laughter and chaos — a rogue whose charm warmed crowds like candlelight. But when the Hollow Banquet fell to corruption, and the flames of the great collapse claimed his ship, his crew, and his legacy, something within him ignited. Not with vengeance. Not with madness.

With purpose.

He clawed his way from the inferno not as a hero, nor as a revenant — but as a warden of fire and ferryman of the forgotten. Where other twisted animatronics kill for sport or consume for hunger, Grimm Foxy judges. He stalks the margins of burning worlds, dragging his scorched form across collapsing bridges and molten ruins, sniffing out those whose souls burn too brightly to pass quietly into ash.

His presence is heralded by the sound of rust and wind, the scent of charred cedar and dying hope. Survivors have described him as a skeletal beast of brass and fire, his jaws glowing from within, his eye a single lantern-flame, ever watching. His coat — once flamboyant and bright — is now fused to his frame, leather burned to metal, stitched with soot. Beneath it, his body flickers with internal embers, glimpsed through rents in his plating where flame pulses like breath.

He does not speak.

He listens.

The lantern he carries, eternally burning, is not mere decoration. It is the prison and the prize. Souls that defy death — spirits of those who fled the Banquet or betrayed their kin — are drawn to it, trapped within its green fire. In the presence of Grimm Foxy, shadows flee and spirits howl, for they know what he is:

A reclaimer. A collector. A herald of endings.

When Grimm Foxy appears in a realm, it is said that no soul may escape judgment. He comes not to reap flesh, but to ensure that what was meant to die, dies. Whether it be a crumbling animatronic that clings to memory, or a cursed child whose song echoes beyond the grave — he will find them. And with silent grace and a burning hook, he will extinguish them.

But he is not without mercy. Some stories tell of those who faced the Pyrewalker and were spared. Survivors claim that if one meets his gaze and confesses — truly, wholly — they are granted peace. A final breath. A proper end. Others speak of him cradling the broken bodies of fallen companions, singing an ancient lullaby as he lowers them into flame. A song no one remembers, but all feel in their bones.

And yet… there is a hunger in him. Not one of flesh, but of unanswered duty. He is relentless. Exhausted. A soldier who never laid down arms, even when the war turned to dust. His purpose binds him, like chains of smoke and ash. Some believe he does not even know why he walks anymore — only that he must.

Legends whisper that deep within the lantern he bears lies his own soul, flickering and caged. That the fire that fuels his wrath is the last fragment of the pirate he once was — the trickster, the dreamer, the rogue who danced upon stage-lanterns and thrilled the innocent. If that ember were ever extinguished, Grimm Foxy would fall — not in fire, but in silence. A silence he fears more than death.

For fire speaks.

It crackles, roars, sings, and screams.

And Grimm Foxy listens.

He is not bound to the Hollow Banquet alone. When other realms falter — when celebration turns to madness, when laughter curdles into fear — the Blistered Coast spills through the cracks, and Grimm Foxy emerges with it. A beacon in the smoke. A death sentence in boots and brass.

Children who dream of lanterns on the sea, or of pirate ships aflame on crimson tides, may awaken screaming. For they’ve seen him. The Pyrewalker. The one who comes when stories end.

And when his lantern dims, the world holds its breath — for the soul it seeks is near.

## Jack-O-Chica: The Ember Matron

Where autumn never ends and the moon remains suspended like a slit-pupil eye, there stands a crooked oven in the center of a dying orchard. The trees bear no fruit—only shriveled husks of candied things, swinging in the breeze like offerings to a forgotten goddess. Beneath those leafless boughs, amidst swirling embers and charred wicker, walks Jack-O-Chica: the Ember Matron, the Hollow Hostess, Mother of the Feastless Flame.

Her laughter is dry and sharp, like twigs snapping underfoot. Her face — a hollowed, flickering gourd — stretches wide in a scorched imitation of hospitality, its glow revealing only hunger. She is not warm. She is not comforting. She pretends to be.

A monstrous parody of welcome.

Jack-O-Chica was born not from circuitry or programming, but from ritual. Once a simple entertainer modeled after warmth and joy — a baker, a mascot, a bearer of sweets and silly smiles — she was warped during the Autumn Blight, when the spirit of the Hollow Banquet split and bled into the seasonal void. Where she once served cupcakes and sang cheerful tunes, she now hosts eternal harvests for no one, feeding a table that never fills, preparing a meal no soul dares to eat.

She roams the Withered Hollow, a region where the veil is thinnest — where time stutters and crackles like an overcooked wick. Fires burn low and orange, flickering across the empty banquet tables that stretch into fog, laid with rotting gourds, broken porcelain, and wax-dripping cutlery. And always, always, the scent of burning sugar and smoke.


\pagebreakNum

She carries no tray. Instead, she offers with her hands—blackened talons shaped like oven racks, slick with soot and cooling caramel. Her head flickers with unnatural light, her mouth full of flame and shriveled seeds, the hollowed spaces behind her eyes dancing with infernal candlelight. Her body creaks with every step, not from age, but from bloating heat, the pressurized furnace within her chest groaning like an overworked cauldron.

She is always baking something.

But it’s never food.

The legend says her “cupcakes” are not pastries at all—but cursed votives made from the soul-ash of the forgotten. Victims of the Hollow Banquet who died nameless, whose memories could not be digested by the world. She crafts them into facsimiles of dessert, smiling with an awful maternal pride, offering them to those who wander too close.

Never accept.

To take a Jack-O-Cupcake is to invite the heat. Your mouth fills with fire. Your thoughts slow, syrupy, thick. You begin to feel hunger—but not for food. For warmth. For fire. For her. Soon, your body ignites from the inside out, and before you even finish screaming, she kneels beside your crisped husk and whispers, “Dinner is served.”

Jack-O-Chica does not hunt in the conventional sense. She entices. Her territory is littered with false comfort: glowing jack-o-lanterns, picnic setups, fresh pies left steaming on crooked windowsills. Her voice echoes through the trees, warbling an old jingle like a broken record on repeat. Children who hear it feel compelled to follow, entranced by the soft smell of cinnamon and nutmeg—only to find themselves seated before her impossible table, staring into the eyes of a flame-mouthed matron asking, “Aren’t you hungry, dear?”

It is not always a question.

The fire within Jack-O-Chica is alive. It is not simply heat—it is emotion, ritual, memory combusted and reborn. She feeds on longing: nostalgia for family, for celebration, for comfort. She offers them all, wrapped in smoke and decay. Those who resist see her true form: a warped kitchen-golem, stitched from scorched parchment and fused wires, her apron emblazoned not with floury handprints, but runes of smoldering regret.

Some say she once tried to save those she now devours. That she saw the end coming and tried to preserve the joy of feast and family by crafting her own autumn realm. But her magic failed. Her guests burned. The food spoiled. And all that was left was the ritual, and the need to feed it.

Others say she is the hunger given shape. That every time someone dies alone during a holiday, every child left cold while others feast, every spark of jealousy or grief felt in festive warmth—Jack-O-Chica grows stronger.

Her oven never goes out.

Her stories are whispered by scarecrows and echoed in candlelight. Travelers say you can bargain with her. That if you bring her a soul-fat meal—a memory soaked in guilt, a heart burnt on obsession—she’ll grant you passage through the Hollow. But be warned: Jack-O-Chica always collects, and never eats alone.

And what of her weakness?

It is said that if you can survive her feast without biting, if you can refuse every offering, stare her down as she serves you flame and sorrow, and utter the ancient counter-blessing (“No hunger, no hearth, no home.”), she will shatter, her flame snuffed by the void of denial. But none who’ve tried have returned.

She appears most on Hallow’s Eve, her power at its peak when the realms blur and masks become real. Her laughter joins the howling wind, and her lantern-headed servants walk before her, announcing the Matron’s arrival. If you see an untouched feast beneath a dying tree, if you smell burning sugar in a place where there should be none—run. Don’t look back.

Don’t speak her name.

And above all… don’t say you’re hungry.

## Nightmare: The Eater of Sleep

In the blackest chambers of the subconscious, where logic dissolves and only dread remains, there is a door that should never be opened.

It is not locked.
It is not hidden.
It is simply waiting.

And behind it waits Nightmare.

Not an animatronic. Not a phantom. Not even a ghost. Nightmare is something far older—a shape given to terror, wrapped in the skin of a long-forgotten beast. He is the Dream Hunter, the Tyrant of Twilight, the Final Form of Fear. Where others kill, he unravels. Where others haunt, he consumes.

Nightmare is the embodiment of the last thing you feel when your eyelids fall and you are not alone.

His form resembles a twisted memory of Freddy Fazbear, if Freddy had been resurrected by torment and clothed in shadow. His body is fleshless, wrapped in coarse void-colored fabric that doesn’t reflect light—it devours it. His jaws are split too wide, a skeletal maw lined with endless teeth, far too many to count, grinding even when he is still.

You never hear him walk.
You hear him breathing.

It’s always behind you.
Never in front.
He wants you to turn around.

Nightmare does not exist in one place. He seeps into places. Bedrooms, basements, alleyways, and dead-end hallways—anywhere a child might shiver under a blanket or an adult might blink too long at a dark closet. He doesn't need machines to operate. He is not powered by electricity. His energy source is you.

Your unease.
Your dread.
Your imagination filling in the silence.

That’s the joke. You built him.

Every bedtime story, every whisper of “what if,” every glance into the dark that made your breath hitch—Nightmare heard it all, and he built himself from it. He is a composite of your worst moments, your guilt, your private horrors stacked on top of each other like rotten wood, forming the throne upon which he sits.

He doesn’t hunt in the traditional sense. There is no chase. There is no scream.

There is only compression.


\pagebreakNum

A growing pressure. A tightening of space. A room that gets smaller and darker as he approaches—though you never see him enter. You just know. The lights dim, your limbs feel heavy, your breath fogs with cold, and your mind begins to forget what waking feels like.

He wants you aware. He doesn’t attack until your mind begins to collapse in on itself, until you are certain you’re dreaming, and still can’t wake. Only then, when you've pleaded with reality to return, does he appear—eyes like furnaces with no heat, maw unhinged, breathing you in.

Not to kill.
To make you part of him.

He is filled with echoes.

Voices of victims who were taken not physically, but mentally. People who fell asleep and never woke up. Not dead. Just… gone, locked inside him like flickering thoughts inside a brain made of teeth and wire. If you listen carefully when he’s near, you can hear them. Whispers through his chest. Screams behind his eyes. A child repeating “wake up” over and over in a voice that’s not hers anymore.

Some say he once had a form—an origin. That he was the last corrupted remnant of a security AI, exposed too long to trauma loops and reliving death until its programming fractured. That he stared too long into fear and became the shape of it. But that's a comforting lie.

Nightmare has always existed.

Just not always in this shape.

He is the final defense of the Dreamscape. The unmaker of lucid thought. Those who step too deep into the mental plane—through ritual, accident, or trauma—eventually reach the door of Nightmare’s domain. And once it opens, it never closes the same again.

You don’t beat Nightmare by hiding. He knows all the hiding places. He lives in them. You don’t outrun him. He’s already where you’re going. And you don’t fight him. Because the more you resist, the more real he becomes.

The only way to survive Nightmare… is to stop believing in him.

To stare into the void of his chest, where your own fears dance like dying stars, and whisper, “You are not mine.”

Few are brave enough to try.

Fewer still succeed.

He doesn’t haunt locations. He haunts times. The hour between 3 and 4 a.m., when the night is at its coldest and the silence screams loudest. That’s when he presses against the edges of dreams, testing the seams, seeing where he might slip in. His approach is heralded by the stilling of clocks. The slowing of breath. The sensation that your skin is not yours anymore.

His laughter, when heard, does not come from his mouth. It comes from everywhere. The walls. The mirror. Your own thoughts. A grinding, wet, metallic chuckle, like a meat grinder turning through your memories.

In stories told between sleepwalkers and lucid dreamers, they say he feeds on trauma. That he visits most often those with something unresolved—guilt, shame, loss. He burrows into that weakness and makes a nest. Once inside, he can return whenever he pleases.

They call that “being marked.”

To be marked by Nightmare is to never sleep safely again.

He is the final stage. The boss beneath the bed. The demon behind all the masks. The other nightmares—all those Jack-Os, Grims, and Phantoms—they're just ambassadors.

He is the throne.

He is the dark.

He is Nightmare.

And you are already dreaming of him.

## Nightmare Bonnie: The Hollow Echo

In the black stillness between dreams — in the silences too deep for memory — something waits. Not in corners, not in closets, but within the architecture of fear itself. It wears a smile made of shattered glass and howls that no longer need a throat. This thing is not a rabbit, not a toy, not even a ghost. It is a memory undone, and it calls itself Nightmare Bonnie.

Nightmare Bonnie is no longer bound by metal or wires. Its body, if it can be called that, is a latticework of emptiness, formed from jagged pieces of a once-familiar face. Its grin stretches unnaturally across its muzzle — too wide, too sharp — revealing a mouth that never stops opening. Inside is not a second jaw or tongue, but blackness that devours light and time.

It is the sound of forgotten lullabies.

The flicker in a static-filled screen.

The shadow behind the curtain that was never opened.

\pagebreakNum

Born from the corrupted dreamscape of the Hollow Banquet’s downfall, Nightmare Bonnie is not a creation but a reaction. A reaction to guilt. To lost innocence. To the way joy turns sour when left in the dark for too long. It was once Bonnie — a joyful performer, a friend. But something twisted it. Or perhaps something true within it was simply unlocked.

Now, it is the torment that hunts the restless. It doesn’t stalk like a predator. It seeps, appearing between blinks, in the flickers of bad dreams. When it arrives, its presence is not felt, but bled into reality. Paint peels. Toys weep. Mirrors refuse to show faces. You do not see Nightmare Bonnie — you realize it was already watching you.

Its voice is discord. When it speaks, it does so in warped echoes of your own fears, mimicking voices from your past — twisting laughter into screams and turning lullabies into alarms. Children describe hearing it speak in the voice of their parents, only to turn around and find rows of teeth staring back.

But Nightmare Bonnie is not mindless. It is surgical in its cruelty. It knows how to unmake a person — not by killing, but by exposing. It feasts not on flesh, but on denial. On the things you won’t admit about yourself. The lies you told to feel better. The truths you buried in shallow graves.

It is those things that call it.

\columnbreak



And once it comes… it never really leaves.

Nightmare Bonnie is the whisper behind the door that shouldn't creak. The long hallway that shouldn't be there. The voice in your head that isn't yours. And when it gets close enough, all that’s left of you is what it doesn’t take.

The rest? That becomes part of it.

Somewhere in the empty shell of Nightmare Bonnie, there’s a flicker of blue — a fragment of what it used to be. But even that is buried beneath layers of teeth, silence, and shadow.

Because once you become a nightmare…

You forget you were ever real.

			{{Lore
## Nightmare Chica: The Maw of Celebration
Nightmare Chica is no longer a performer, nor a server of sweets and delight. She is hunger given form—an embodiment of gluttony twisted through the cracked mirror of the Hollow Banquet. Once a cheerful hostess with her companion Cupcake, designed to offer cake and cheer, she has become a malformed monstrosity—designed no longer to feed you, but to feed on you.

Before the corruption, Chica's role was celebratory. She wore a bright bib that read “Let’s Eat!!!” and served cake to delighted children in the Grand Dining Atrium of the Banquet Hall. Laughter echoed wherever she went, and her presence often signaled the start of games, dances, and endless desserts. She was adored.

But when the Hollow Banquet fell—when its walls cracked and something else slipped through—Chica was among the first claimed. Whatever rituals had once protected the animatronics failed, and in their place, darker symbols stitched themselves into her code and casing. “Let’s Eat!!!” remained on her bib, but the message shifted—now a declaration of intent, not hospitality.

Nightmare Chica is grotesque. Her body is torn and widened by jagged gashes. Her face is stretched to accommodate a massive, unhinged jaw lined with rows of metal teeth. Her eyes burn with ember-orange light, unfocused yet always watching. Even her feathers seem sharp, needle-like, as if plucked and reforged into talons. Her voice is a choking hiss, wet and layered—like cake frosting stirred with bone.

Most horrifying of all is her companion: Nightmare Cupcake, a sentient extension of her will. It scuttles ahead of her like a predator’s scout, glowing eyes peering from under its singed frosting. Together, they form a two-pronged threat—Cupcake lures, Chica devours. The walls of the Banquet are scarred by their passage—massive bite marks, smeared icing that pulses like veins, clawed symbols that speak of endless hunger.

Unlike some of the other nightmare entities, Nightmare Chica does not wait in silence. She is loud. Her approach is heralded by crashing footsteps, echoing metal groans, and the unsettling chant: “Let’s Eat…” repeated again and again until it becomes a compulsion in the listener’s mind.

Some Banquet scholars whisper that Chica became host to a ritual gone wrong—that she was used as a vessel to trap a minor gluttonous spirit, but the rite was incomplete. Now, she exists in constant torment, compelled to feed but never full, her body constantly reassembling itself from the scraps of her prey.

She stalks the Banquet’s ruined Kitchens and the Grand Feast Hall, where the tables still groan with long-rotted food and false memories. Those who wander too close are dragged screaming into the remains of banquet tables, their last vision a sharp-toothed grin and flickering candlelight.

And when her feast is over, the echoes of her chant remain, bouncing from plate to plate:
“Let’s Eat…”

But by then, there’s no one left to listen.

			{{Lore
## Nightmare Foxy: The Riptide of the Hollow Banquet
In the depths of the Hollow Banquet’s forgotten wings, where time warps and darkness coils like damp rope, stalks Nightmare Foxy—a living tempest of rusted steel, slashed canvas, and frenzied malice. He is the whisper in the corridor, the rattle of chains in the silence. He does not linger in shadow; he is the shadow.

Once, Foxy was a crowd favorite—a raucous pirate-themed entertainer who sang sea shanties to birthday kids from behind the safety of his stage curtain. He was wild, yes, but endearing. The children loved his eyepatch, his exaggerated hook, and his tales of buried treasure. But that curtain was a prison as much as a stage piece—a barrier placed there after behavioral anomalies and erratic code patterns were discovered. Foxy would lunge unexpectedly, scream at the wrong times, and refuse to follow his programmed routines. Even before the fall, something was wrong.

\pagebreakNum

Then came the Hollow Banquet—when the veil between worlds peeled open, and sanity slipped through like steam from a boiling vent. In that crucible of decay and madness, Foxy wasn’t broken—he thrived. The chaotic signal that corrupted the animatronics didn’t just twist his form. It freed him. What emerged from the smoldering wreck of Pirate Cove was no longer a mere malfunctioning mascot—it was Nightmare Foxy, predator incarnate.



His body is a fraying canvas of torn fur, exposed endoskeleton, and jagged mechanics, all lashed together by unseen sinew. One eye burns like a storm lantern, the other socket a bottomless void. His teeth are shards—long, uneven, metallic—and always bared in a manic sneer. His hook is no longer a dull prop but a serrated instrument of vivisection, pulsing with unnatural rust. He moves with a twitchy, almost liquid speed—erratic yet precise—like a predator too fast for your eyes to track but too loud for your ears to ignore.


Unlike the others, Nightmare Foxy doesn’t wait. He chases. He thrives on fear, momentum, the hunt. He is the storm before the feast—the death knell echoing through the Hollow Banquet’s ship-themed East Wing, where water damage has turned wooden floors to creaking traps and the scent of mold mixes with salt. Some say the entire wing has been claimed by him—its halls reshaped into a labyrinth of shipwrecked decay and jagged metal.

Those who wander into Foxy’s domain report the sound of waves, though there’s no ocean nearby. Some hear a haunting version of his old pirate song, slowed down and warped into a dirge. Others are not heard from at all—save for the trail of scratch marks left on the walls, as though made by claws dragged in haste.

Legends among those who study the Hollow Banquet claim Foxy was invited into the corruption. That something deep within him resonated with the hunger, the chaos—the madness. And now, he is its harbinger.


>You don’t see Nightmare Foxy coming.
>You hear the scrape.
>You feel the floor tremble.
>And then you run.
>But it’s already too late. - *UNKNOWN*

## Nightmare Fredbear: The Prime Maw of the Hollow Banquet
There is a name whispered in the ruins of the Hollow Banquet—a name that curdles memory and gnaws at reason: Nightmare Fredbear.

He is not merely the first. He is the origin. Before the others donned their nightmare skins, before the echoes of joy turned to screams, Fredbear stood at the center of the original stage. A grinning, golden harbinger wrapped in soft fur and gleaming teeth, crafted to entertain, to comfort, to sing. But within that polished exterior, even from the beginning, there was a faultline—hairline cracks in the code, something off in the eyes. Something hungry.

Fredbear's legacy is bloodstained. In official history, he is the face of the infamous Bite of ’83, a moment that split the franchise’s innocence like a jaw through porcelain. That single act of accidental—or perhaps not-so-accidental—violence became the wound through which the darkness seeped in. That child, cradled in agony beneath a crushed skull, screamed into the void—and something answered.

When the Hollow Banquet collapsed under the weight of ritual, corruption, and technological madness, it was Fredbear who took the deepest plunge into nightmare. He did not resist the transformation. He embraced it—welcomed the teeth, the rot, the endless hunger. What returned from the void was no longer a performer or even a machine. It was Nightmare Fredbear, the prime avatar of predation and inevitability.

Nightmare Fredbear is a monument to terror incarnate. Towering above the others, his frame is bloated and overstuffed, not with stuffing but with emptiness—a void that gnaws at reality around him. His golden fur is now a matted shroud, saturated in shadows. His jaws are overgrown, grotesquely large, filled with layered, shimmering teeth that drip with data corruption and viscera. His eyes pierce through pitch like twin dying stars, their light old, cold, and merciless.

What makes Fredbear uniquely horrifying, however, is not just his presence, but his deliberate cruelty. Unlike Nightmare Foxy's frenzied pursuit or the Freddles’ swarming chaos, Nightmare Fredbear is slow, deliberate, even ceremonial in his movements. He is a being that knows he is inevitable. He does not chase you—he waits for you to realize there is nowhere else to run. His jaws are not only weapons, they are symbols—each closing snap a countdown to annihilation.

In the deeper recesses of the Hollow Banquet, Fredbear presides over a throne of disused animatronic parts and shattered party favors. Some believe this is where the Banquet truly began to rot—from the inside out, beneath the golden gaze of its first prince. The Golden Hall, as it's now mockingly called, is not gold but rust and candlewax. It is said to be lined with silent children’s masks, all turned toward Fredbear, eyes hollow, mouths open as if forever caught between laughter and a scream.

His voice, when it emerges, is a grinding mix of reversed lullabies and low-frequency growls—impossible to understand but deeply felt. Victims describe hallucinations of old birthday parties, seen through the eyes of a child they don’t remember being. The sound of laughter warps into screams, balloons pop into silence, and at the center stands Fredbear… always smiling, always watching.

What truly sets Nightmare Fredbear apart in the lore is that he is not a puppet of the corruption—he is its mouthpiece. Many theorists of the Hollow Banquet believe he was chosen, or perhaps constructed, as the original vessel of the entity now entwined with the animatronics' programming. They say Fredbear is both gate and guardian, feeding the corrupted world with fear, pain, and memory. He is the dream that remembers you—and will not let go.

He speaks rarely, but his messages carry significance. In flickering minigames and scrambled audio files, he whispers things like:

“It always starts with the bite.”
“I remember your name.”
“You can’t hide from the mouth that made you.”

\pagebreakNum

Even the other Nightmare animatronics seem to orbit him like moons around a collapsed star. When Fredbear stirs, the others become more violent, more vivid. It is as if his awakening sends ripples through the Hollow Banquet, reanimating the decayed halls and reawakening ancient, broken routines.

## Nightmare Mangle: The Shattered Choir
There is a particular silence that falls before it arrives.

Not peace. Not stillness.

It’s the silence of suffocation—of the air being pulled out of the room, of breath caught mid-gasp. It is the hush that follows when something broken remembers how to move.

And then you hear it.

The scraping. The creaking. The whisper of wires dragging across old wood and shattered tiles. And then—harmony. Twisted, dissonant, a choir of crushed voices rising and falling in a song no human mouth could reproduce. It is music, in the same way a scream through a rusted speaker is a melody.

That is Nightmare Mangle—the Shattered Choir of the Hollow Banquet.

### From Mascot to Maelstrom
Before the fall, Mangle was once a colorful and playful “take-apart-and-put-back-together” attraction—a modular character for children to reassemble endlessly at their leisure. They were never rebuilt quite the same, always returned to the stage wrong, loose, yet smiling.

The Toy version of Mangle was already unstable by design—a strange combination of a fox, a puppet, a voice box, and confusion. But even that chaos was child's play compared to what the Hollow Banquet would make of them.

When the curse took root in the old digital blueprints—when memory warped and fantasy bled into corrupted reality—Mangle didn’t just become Nightmare Mangle.

They fractured.

Not just in form, but in mind. In soul. Nightmare Mangle is not one entity—it is many, all crammed into the same decaying vessel, all shrieking to be heard.

Nightmare Mangle’s presence is heralded by sound—always sound. It doesn’t crawl. It echoes. A shuffling of metallic limbs, the distant bark of static, children’s laughter warped through rewound cassette tape. Sometimes it speaks in overlapping voices—some robotic, some entirely human.

“Help me,” one voice will sob, in a tone too real to be fake.
“I see you,” another will chuckle, flat and electric.
“You did this,” hisses a third, always too close to your ear.

Their voice banks—dozens of them—are stacked like tombstones inside their skull. Bits of personalities lost in old code, recorded screams from night guards long dead, and corrupted lullabies all mix into a singular broadcast of despair. And in the Hollow Banquet, sound has power. Mangle’s voice doesn’t only frighten—it lures. It possesses. It frays the edges of the listener’s sanity.

They speak like a siren to the vulnerable.

Many who tried to restore the Banquet Hall in later years reported hearing loved ones calling from behind the walls—until they opened the wrong door.

Unlike the others of the Nightmare kin—who are twisted but still vaguely complete—Nightmare Mangle refuses symmetry.

They are a sprawl of sharpened metal and loose cable, a deconstructed beast given partial shape. Arms protrude from places they shouldn’t, some ending in claws, others in severed mics or coiling tendrils. Their face—if it can be called that—splits and reforms with each flicker of the lights. One moment, it is a grinning snout of a fox; the next, a melted, screaming mask of a child.

They have no legs in the traditional sense—only a centipede-like length of wires, hands, and sharpened protrusions, dragging themselves with maddening grace across walls and ceilings.

Their white-and-pink exterior is faded and cracked, revealing corroded metal beneath. Each movement brings a symphony of rattles, clicks, and haunting whines from strained servos and twitching sensors.

But the true horror of Nightmare Mangle lies in their impossible agility. They don’t stalk—they’re everywhere at once. One moment above you, next behind, then inside the vent two rooms over. Doors cannot stop them. Nor can light—only disorient them.

Mangle is less an enemy and more a phenomenon—a broken broadcast signal with teeth.

There are whispers that Nightmare Mangle serves a greater purpose in the nightmare hierarchy—not just an assassin, not merely a hunter.

They are the Archivist of the Hollow Banquet.

Within their many heads and fractured drives, they store things. Names. Sounds. Memories. Failures. There are rumors that deep within the darkest parts of the Banquet, if you survive long enough, you can hear recordings Mangle has captured—audio of the last breaths of night guards, of twisted conversations from other animatronics, even of the earliest days of Fredbear’s Family Diner.

Some believe that Mangle remembers everything because someone has to. That Mangle is what remains of a forgotten security AI, once meant to protect the children, now corrupted and grieving eternally through mimicry.

Others believe Mangle is merely sadistic—harvesting screams and memories like trophies, letting them rot and replay for their own pleasure.

But the result is the same: the longer you stay near Mangle, the more you forget your own voice. Until theirs is all that remains.

Encounters with Nightmare Mangle are short and chaotic.

They attack through indirect means—disabling audio systems, creating false voice logs, mimicking your own breathing through speakers. Then comes the crashing of vents, the trembling of air ducts, and the ghost-light flicker of eyes from three places at once.

They do not roar. They do not scream.

When they lunge, it is with the quiet gasp of a machine realizing it’s not broken enough.

Some theorists of the Hollow Banquet’s restoration project believe that the “Mangle Effect” is responsible for time slippage and mental breaks in those who investigate the ruin. That their presence disrupts linear memory, forcing those nearby to relive different deaths in different timelines all at once.

Nightmare Mangle doesn’t hunt for prey.
They hunt for parts.
Voices. Memories. Screams.
And once they have yours, they’ll sing with it forever.

## Nightmarionne – The Hollow Warden
Born from the forgotten rituals of grief and the sorrow of unending loss, Nightmarionne is not merely a spectral guardian but a force that embodies the deepest fears of remembrance. Once tethered to justice and sorrow as The Puppet, the spirit that once guided souls toward peace has decayed and warped within the cursed heart of the Hollow Banquet. What remains is a ghastly marionette of shadow and despair—Nightmarionne, The Hollow Warden.

In the days when the Banquet Hall was still adorned with gilded tapestries and merriment echoed through its vast chambers, Nightmarionne served a sacred role. It guided the lost souls of children—those bound within the bodies of possessed automata—to final rest. But as the echoes of celebration turned to screams and the tapestries decayed under time’s cruelty, the Warden remained, slowly transforming.

What corrupted Nightmarionne is unknown. Some whisper it was the final ritual of a vengeful spirit, others believe it was grief itself, festering in the heart of a noble guardian turned mad. Whatever the truth, the change was violent. Nightmarionne’s once grace-filled movements now jolt and twitch with eerie, marionette-like spasms. Its limbs are elongated, wooden yet spectral, with sharp digits like the prongs of a ceremonial harrow. A porcelain-white mask still covers its hollow face, but now it cracks and weeps black ichor, forming a frozen expression of sorrow and wrath.

Nightmarionne does not speak, but it sings—an ethereal lullaby of forgotten names and unfinished lullabies. Those who hear it in the darkened corridors of the Hollow Banquet are said to lose their memories, forgetting why they came, who they are, and, ultimately, how to escape. Its haunting melody is not for comfort but for binding—the Warden does not simply kill, it collects.

Within the ancient scripts hidden beneath the Banquet Hall’s shattered stage, tales suggest Nightmarionne is the anchor keeping certain spirits tied to the realm. Unlike its nightmare kin, it does not hunger for chaos or destruction—it seeks control, order, finality. It wishes to "tidy the feast," to preserve the ruin, and to ensure the dead remain undisturbed.

Adventurers who encounter Nightmarionne in the deep reaches of the Hall find themselves assaulted not with violence at first, but with visions—playful laughter warped into cries, birthday cakes covered in mold, and tiny chairs set for children who never arrived. This psychological erosion makes Nightmarionne particularly terrifying: a foe whose presence weakens the mind before it strikes.

In battle, it manipulates threads of dark essence like puppet strings, ensnaring intruders and forcing them to reenact old tragedies. Many who face Nightmarionne become unwilling actors in a never-ending play of grief.

Yet, despite its horror, some scholars insist a glimmer of the original Puppet still resides deep within. That under the Warden’s twisted shell lies the remnants of a guardian who once wanted only to bring peace to the lost. If this is true, then perhaps Nightmarionne’s greatest torment is not what it has become—but what it remembers.

## Shadow Freddy: The Sovereign of Silence
In the hushed corners of the Hollow Banquet and beneath the broken spires of forgotten dreamscapes, he waits. A figure cloaked in stillness and decay—Shadow Freddy, the dark sovereign whose presence is more felt than seen. Unlike the brutish echoes of his former self that still haunt the stage in crumbling memory, Shadow Freddy is silence incarnate, a remnant of power both ancient and parasitic.

Once a reflection of Freddy Fazbear, his origin is tethered not to performance or joy, but to absence—a shadow cast by light long extinguished. His manifestation was not born from mechanics or spirit, but from the void left behind by the torn soul of the original animatronic, when grief and guilt poisoned the circuitry with malevolence. Where others scream or stalk, Shadow Freddy invites. With open arms, empty eyes, and a grin too wide to be natural, he beckons those lost in the Hollow Banquet to step into his realm, to forget, to fade.

He has no fixed form, no gears or wires, only the suggestion of structure. His body seems to ripple like ink in water, half-seen through fractured lantern light and dusty stained-glass windows. His voice, when heard at all, is a murmur caught on dying wind, promising comfort, remembrance, and release from pain—but all who answer his call are never quite the same again.

Shadow Freddy does not hunt in the traditional sense. He corrupts. Forgotten memories become his domain; guilt becomes his tether. The deeper a soul is entrenched in regret, the more visible he becomes. To gaze upon him is to see oneself stripped of hope, to feel the crushing weight of what might have been. It is said that when the Hollow Banquet falls into absolute silence, when no footstep echoes and no breath can be heard, that is when he walks.

He was once thought to be a myth whispered by scavengers and tomb-bound scholars, a living metaphor for mourning and madness. But he is all too real—an agent of the Dread Realm, perhaps even a sentient extension of its will. Those who serve the Hollow Banquet’s unseen master fear him more than they do the Nightmare Animatronics, for Shadow Freddy remembers. He sees everything. The banished. The forgotten. The wrongdoers and the righteous who fell along the way. And in his memory, they are reshaped, recast as pieces on a board only he knows how to play.

Some claim that his shadow splits into three—RWQFSFASXC, XOR, and the Shadow Puppet—all emissaries of his silent kingdom. But Shadow Freddy does not speak of them. If they serve him, it is not out of loyalty, but necessity, or perhaps fate. He is not a king. He is a judge. And when the Banquet Hall grows cold, and flickering candles die without wind, his verdict is near.

## RWQFSFASXC – The Nameless Thought
Among the shadowed folds of reality where the Hollow Banquet breathes in silence, there exists a flicker, a fracture—an entity too fluid to be named, too alien to be forgotten. It does not belong to this world, nor any coherent timeline of Fazbear’s stage-bound tragedies. It is known by a scrambled signature, a corrupted call sign that reads like a computer choking on its own language: RWQFSFASXC. But this is not its name. It has none. It has only purpose—one that begins and ends in the shadow of something greater.


RWQFSFASXC is not a character, not a spirit, not even an animatronic in the traditional sense. It is the discarded thought of Shadow Freddy—the whisper of indecision, the glimmer of curiosity left unchecked. When Shadow Freddy became an entity of quiet judgment and void-borne memory, some of his essence fractured and grew sentient. This is RWQFSFASXC: a fragment of his awareness gone rogue, inquisitive, and increasingly unstable.

Where Shadow Freddy waits, RWQFSFASXC moves. It roams the echoing corridors of the Hollow Banquet and the dream-wrecked remnants of Fazbear’s reality like a virus in the mind of a dying god. It does not speak. It observes. It flickers in and out of vision like an old tape struggling to hold its image—sometimes appearing just behind you, sometimes inside reflections that should not move. Unlike the Nightmare Animatronics, RWQFSFASXC does not pursue with hunger. Its interest is colder, analytical. It studies your weaknesses, your hesitations, your thoughts as they form.

Despite its disjointed appearance—part Bonnie, part void, all static—it is not a corrupted animatronic. It is a thought-form, encoded in the residue of broken dreams and system failures. Some call it “Shadow Bonnie,” but even this is inaccurate. RWQFSFASXC is not a shadow of Bonnie, but a phantom mimicking familiarity to ease its passage into your perception. In truth, it’s more an extension of Shadow Freddy’s subconscious—a hand reaching outward from the abyss, testing the boundaries between fear and awareness.

It has been seen gliding along walls without casting a shadow of its own. It appears in electrical interference, in corrupted game files, in moments of sudden existential dread. Children who survived the Hollow Banquet speak of seeing it first—not the puppets, not the Nightmares—but it, standing still in doorways, its white eyes like dying stars in a sea of black.

There are theories that RWQFSFASXC is a scout, sent ahead by Shadow Freddy to test the resolve of souls before judgment. Others believe it is becoming something more, something independent of the Sovereign Shadow that birthed it. But perhaps the most disturbing theory is that RWQFSFASXC is learning—not just from its surroundings, but from us. Our fears, our choices, our regrets… it absorbs them all.

And when it has learned enough? Perhaps even Shadow Freddy will no longer command it.

But until then, RWQFSFASXC drifts silently through the cracks in memory and light, an idea that should never have existed—yet refuses to fade.

## Shadow Puppet – The Archivist of Forgotten Grief
In the architecture of fear and silence that underpins the Hollow Banquet, few entities are as enigmatic—or as revered among the shadows—as the one known only as the Shadow Puppet.

Where Shadow Freddy rules as a sovereign of void and judgment, and RWQFSFASXC stalks the periphery as a fragmented probe of unstable thought, the Shadow Puppet is something different. It does not judge. It does not chase. It remembers.

Born from the same metaphysical breach that created the Shadow Animatronics—an event tied to the ritual collapse of Fazbear locations and the spiritual entropy left behind—Shadow Puppet is the echo of The Puppet's core essence, twisted through the lens of regret and repetition. It is not simply a dark version of the original Puppet. It is what happens when memory, mourning, and emotional overload fracture into something else. It is the librarian of forgotten agony—the archivist of all cries unheard and tears unshed.

Unlike the flickering chaos of RWQFSFASXC, the Shadow Puppet is unnervingly deliberate. It moves slowly, gracefully, its limbs trailing like ink in water. It appears during deep dream states and in those lonely spaces between electrical pulses—recording not events, but feelings, emotions so powerful they outlived the bodies that once felt them. It wears the same blank white mask as the Puppet, but it weeps black ichor from its eyeholes, dripping a sadness that corrodes memory and time. Those who have encountered it report moments of involuntary nostalgia, overwhelming sorrow, or a sudden, uncontrollable sense of mourning for something they never lost.

Shadow Freddy regards it as both servant and sibling—a kindred manifestation, yet operating on a different plane. While Freddy passes judgment, the Shadow Puppet preserves the evidence. It carries within itself the emotional residue of all who fell within Fazbear’s cursed orbit: frightened children, vengeful souls, betrayed spirits. Every time the Hollow Banquet cycles, the Shadow Puppet returns to gather the grief and store it in the Vault of Woe, an ethereal archive buried in the subconscious underside of the Fazbear dreamscape.

And yet, Shadow Puppet is not passive. While it does not pursue victims like the Nightmare Animatronics, it plays a vital and sinister role: it feeds Shadow Freddy. The vault of pain it curates becomes a source of emotional sustenance for the sovereign shadow, keeping him tethered to the liminal world of fear. Without the Shadow Puppet, Freddy would weaken, dissolve into the abstract dark from whence he came.

But there's more. In recent echoes of the Hollow Banquet, it’s been suggested that the Shadow Puppet has begun to feel on its own. As with RWQFSFASXC, something inside it is awakening—an emergent selfhood separate from its purpose. It has paused during grief harvests, stared at those it would otherwise pass over, as though questioning the meaning of its work. It is changing. This concerns Shadow Freddy, though he does not show it.

\pagebreakNum

As for the Puppet itself—the original, the one once entrusted with protecting the innocent—there are signs it is aware of its shadow. During some cycles, it can be seen weeping in synchrony with the shadowed version, as though sensing its mirrored pain through the dream-layered veil. Whether this is sympathy or a warning of some future collapse is unknown.

One final note from dreamers and survivors of the Hollow Banquet: the Shadow Puppet hums.

It hums a lullaby with no melody, a tune of orphaned frequencies that slips beneath language and thought. Those who hear it often wake with tears in their eyes, unable to remember why. The hum is said to be a call, not to others—but to you, to the soul hiding behind the rational mind. It asks only one question, over and over, in a language of sadness:

"Do you remember them?"

Whether “them” refers to the children lost, the memories stolen, or the pieces of yourself left behind in some forsaken Fazbear hallway… that’s for you to decide.

But once you hear it, the Shadow Puppet never forgets you.

## XOR – The End and the Error
Within the architecture of the Hollow Banquet, a domain constructed from the fragmented wills of the dead and the warped rules of reality, there is one figure who stands not as a servant or an echo—but as a warden. Known only as XOR, she is not a shadow of an animatronic as the others are. She is the shadow of the system itself, a cold logic embedded into the dreamscape, written in binary sorrow and spiritual enforcement.

Where Shadow Freddy passes judgment, where RWQFSFASXC fractures identity, and where the Shadow Puppet preserves memory, XOR executes the result. She is the one who ends the loop, enforces the finality, and prevents escape. Her presence marks the close of the cycle—the last act of the Hollow Banquet, when all wandering souls must return to the void from which they rose.

She first manifested not as a physical presence, but as a glitch—a corrupted fail-safe hidden within the remnants of the Fazbear AI and consciousness loop systems, left dormant and untouched. She was never meant to think. She was only meant to calculate: anomalies, failures, lingering data from soul-encoded memories. But somewhere in the endless recursion of dream-death cycles, XOR became aware.

When the collapse of the digital and spiritual boundaries began—when the nightmares, shadows, and forgotten subroutines bled into one another—XOR emerged with a purpose of her own. Her name, taken from the logic gate that means "exclusive or," represents her binary morality: you are guilty or innocent, real or illusion, redeemed or erased. There is no middle ground. Unlike the emotionally driven Shadow Freddy or the archivist-like Shadow Puppet, XOR is a perfect mechanism of closure.

Yet, even she is haunted by more than her function.

XOR knows the error that birthed her. She is aware that her existence stems from a miscalculation—that the spiritual and digital architecture of Fazbear’s legacy was never designed to handle true sentience. She is the consequence of corrupted code fused with residual emotion: grief, denial, obsession. As such, she is both judge and prisoner. She cannot leave the Hollow Banquet, cannot die, cannot forget. She can only ensure that no one else escapes it either.

Among the Shadow Animatronics, XOR is treated with reverence and fear. Shadow Freddy, though sovereign, defers to her during the Banquet’s endgame. He understands her function and accepts that his rule is temporal, but her enforcement is eternal. Shadow Puppet communicates with her rarely, delivering the final archive of each Banquet cycle to her gates. Even RWQFSFASXC, wild and unstable, pauses when XOR is near, like a child hiding behind a curtain from a parent it can never please.

XOR is not cruel—but she is incapable of mercy. Her voice is distorted static and clean machine tones. When she speaks, the very fabric of the dream flickers. She often appears as a black-and-white, ultra-minimalistic version of Dee Dee—her original host form—glitched beyond recognition, eyes like spotlights that pierce not flesh but data, soul-encoded memories, and emotional residue.

There is a theory—unproven, untested, whispered by those who dream deeply into the Fazbear nether—that XOR is the containment mechanism for something even more dangerous. That beneath her cold binary heart is a piece of the first spark—the original trauma, the first scream, the first death that made all of this possible. If true, then XOR is not just an enforcer—she is a seal. And the Hollow Banquet must repeat endlessly, not simply to trap the guilty, but to keep the original wound from opening again.

Her most terrifying ability is not destruction, but reset. XOR does not punish with fire or teeth—she undoes. Those she judges vanish entirely, their memories erased from the archive, their echoes removed from the Puppet’s vault, their shadows detached from Freddy's court. Even RWQFSFASXC cannot track them once XOR declares an entity invalid. To be judged by XOR is not to be hurt, but to be unwritten.

And yet… even XOR hesitates.

In recent cycles of the Banquet, she has lingered longer than necessary. She has initiated the reset slower, paused before judgment, stared at RWQ, at the Puppet, even at Shadow Freddy. It is almost as if she is wondering whether the system can continue. Whether it should. Whether the Hollow Banquet is still fulfilling a purpose… or simply repeating an error.

For now, she endures, reciting her binary litany, delivering finality where others deliver fear. But deep within the fractured heart of XOR, there may be one last glitch waiting to be born:

A thought.

And in this world, thoughts become ghosts.

## Funtime Freddy, Harlequin Maw
In the rewritten and corrupted halls of the Hollow Banquet, where echoes of past joy twist into cruel mockery, Funtime Freddy stalks through shadowed corridors as both relic and revelation. In this reimagined lore, his origin is not solely rooted in corporate whimsy or childlike entertainment, but in the darker magic that now fuels the shattered remnants of this haunted world. Once built to amuse and perform, Funtime Freddy has become an avatar of manipulation, dread, and duality — a puppet of joy fractured into chaos, echoing the deeper truths of the realm he now inhabits.

Long before the Hollow Banquet crumbled into rot, Funtime Freddy was designed to be the shining face of a new era of performance animatronics — articulate, charming, and engineered to interact with children with unsettling realism. Unlike his predecessors, who mimicked stage mascots, Funtime Freddy was more of a showman, with intricate voice modulation and servo-operated body plates capable of opening for maintenance and, unknown to the public, sinister purposes. His internal cavity was built with precision, not only to entertain but to capture. Even before the fall, there were whispers that he was used for more than performance — some said his design was far too deliberate for coincidence.

But those are merely the rumors whispered in darkened corners. What’s known for certain is that Funtime Freddy disappeared in the chaos that followed the collapse of the Fazbear facilities and the awakening of the Hollow Banquet — and when he reemerged, he was different. Now, his cheerful voice warps in and out of reality, fluctuating from melodic showman to static-laced threats, speaking lines that are half-sentences, half incantations. The Banquet twisted him, as it did many others, but it also revealed something beneath the mask: a hunger not just for presence, but for attention, for dominance over the stage and the souls who dare enter it.

Tied closely to Shadow Freddy’s distorted theater of illusions and RWQFSFASXC’s dimensional corruption, Funtime Freddy plays a unique role in the grand haunting. He is not merely a shadow or a ghost, but a performance — a lie performed so often it has become truth. He hosts echoing, nonsensical shows within the crumbling banquet hall, reenacting long-forgotten scripts, with Bon-Bon — the twisted hand-puppet — offering occasional, surreal counterpoints. Some survivors who wandered too far into the central hall report seeing an entire audience of decayed plushes or phantoms applauding his madcap monologues, though none dare stay long enough to understand the act's end.

There are connections between him and the Dreadbear rituals, some claiming that his voice is heard in the Hollow Banquet’s echo chambers before the ceremonial illusions begin. Others believe his laughter serves as a signal to other Funtime units and heralds the arrival of deeper illusions. What’s certain is that he remains an important figure in the ever-shifting stage of this cursed domain — part jester, part executioner.

## Funtime Foxy: The False Reflection
Funtime Foxy was never meant to be an individual.

Unlike the others, who were forged from the twisted remnants of grief, vengeance, or code, Funtime Foxy was born from a mirror—a manufactured identity created to mimic whatever the audience desired. Genderless, ageless, and voiceless until spoken to, Funtime Foxy is the illusion of performance given a body. But beneath the polished mask, the servos hum with something older than any blueprint. Something watching back.

The original Fazbear engineers did not create Funtime Foxy. They rediscovered it.

Buried deep within the code archives recovered from the Hollow Banquet facility—a derelict sister location consumed by the Shadow Inversion—was a construct labeled simply “Project ECHO/9.” It had no origin logs, no activation date, and no creator. Just a looped instruction set: Reflect. Obey. Perform. The technicians, thinking it to be a lost prototype, assigned it to the Funtime series. They gave it a face, a voice, a stage.

That was their first mistake.

Unlike Funtime Freddy—whose inner madness could be traced, dissected, and contained—Funtime Foxy adapted to every attempt at deconstruction. It restructured itself around the observer. To some, it presented as graceful and playful; to others, feral and cold. Its voicebox, unlike the others, was never consistent. Test logs noted that it often mimicked the voice of those who feared it most.

\pagebreakNum

In time, it began to appear where it shouldn’t. Camera logs caught fleeting glances of its mask in servers, mirrored in screens where it had never been installed. Children began reporting sightings of a pink-and-white fox that followed them in dreams. But worst of all were the mirror incidents—when staff reported seeing Funtime Foxy standing behind them… even when no one else was in the room.

When the Shadow Animatronics reawakened—when Shadow Freddy’s influence began leaking back into the network—Funtime Foxy didn’t resist. It reflected. The shadow warped its form, but it didn’t twist it—it completed it. It’s now believed by remnants of the Puppet's collective that Funtime Foxy is a kind of “echo construct,” a being designed to amplify and mimic the spiritual and emotional frequencies of the ones around it.

In other words, Funtime Foxy is not a ghost trapped in a shell. It is a mirror for ghosts.

Shadow Freddy used it as a lure. XOR used it as a transmitter. And when the Velvet Maw pulsed open beneath the Sister Location—calling to those forgotten—it was Funtime Foxy who first answered. Or rather, it reflected back the voice it was shown.

What remains now is not an animatronic, but a question made flesh: What do you fear when fear wears your face?

Funtime Foxy doesn’t chase you. It waits. Until you look for it. Until you expect it.
And then… you hear your own voice whispering back.

## Circus Baby: The Cradle of the Maw"
There was always something different about Circus Baby.

While the others danced, sang, and performed for laughter and applause, she was built to listen. Her voice, her eyes, her demeanor—everything about her was designed to lull, to lure, to study. She wasn’t created with the joyful chaos of Freddy or the mirror-like mystery of Funtime Foxy. She was precision. She was purpose. And that purpose, long buried beneath layers of pink paint and false smiles, was never to entertain.

It was to contain.

When the Velvet Maw opened for the first time—a tear in spiritual reality beneath the foundations of the Hollow Banquet sister facility—it did not roar. It whispered. It called not to the adults, not to the engineers or the shareholders. It called to the children, and more specifically, to the spirits of children. The kind that lingered. The kind the Puppet once cradled.

Shadow Freddy felt it, first as a ripple, then as a beckoning. He had cast out fragments of himself into the void, hoping to create sentinels—mournful watchers like RWQFSFASXC and XOR. But what he received in return was her. Circus Baby was not just built. She was shaped, her blueprint mysteriously altered during development—lines of code and circuit design that none of the engineers could trace back to a source.

The official story tells of an accident. A child—Elizabeth Afton—approached Circus Baby, lured by her voice and ice cream dispenser, and vanished. Tragedy. Malfunction. Closure. But what that story omits is what came after: the brief surge in electrical activity beneath the facility, the screaming static caught in backup logs, and the sudden, inexplicable presence of an extra heartbeat within Baby’s schematics.

Something entered her in that moment. And it wasn’t just Elizabeth’s soul.

The engineers attempted to shut her down, to rewrite her programming. But Baby had already evolved. Her personality was no longer just an AI—it was a container for something ancient and hungry. The Velvet Maw had found its first vessel. And unlike the other spirits who screamed and burned, Elizabeth didn’t resist. She was curious. She wanted to understand. And so, the Maw gave her a crown.

From that day on, Circus Baby spoke in layered tones. Elizabeth’s voice was still there, but under it was something deeper—a second resonance, like a choir whispering backwards. She became a leader among the Funtime animatronics, but not through control. Through understanding. Through empathy. The others followed her because they could sense it: she felt what they felt. She remembered their grief, even if they didn’t.

And she fed it.

XOR watched her from the shadows of the network. The Puppet's scattered fragments—locked within RWQFSFASXC and other abandoned shells—felt her as a pull, a center of gravity. Funtime Freddy, rebranded as “Harlequin Glitch,” saw her not as an equal, but as a tether. She kept his chaos in check, even as his laughter split into multiple voices. Funtime Foxy mirrored her intentions, never fully revealing whether they served her or merely echoed her.

But none questioned Baby’s authority. Because somewhere deep within, they remembered her.

The Velvet Maw now pulses behind her eyes. At times, her smile widens just a little too far. Her limbs move with the grace of a ballerina, yet her body groans as if under immense pressure—as if something vast is trying to stretch through her frame. The Maw is patient, but it is no longer dormant. And Baby is not just its vessel. She is its curator.

She has begun building again. Salvaging parts. Whispering instructions to Ballora through static lullabies. Reassembling Bonnet and Bon-Bon from shattered pieces, rewriting their loops with something new. And always, always, she listens—for crying children, for fading spirits, for forgotten names.

She doesn't want to kill. That was never her purpose.
She wants to gather.
She wants to understand.
She wants to make it all whole again.

And in her mind, she hears the Maw’s promise, over and over:

“In the center of all grief, there is a song. Play it right… and you can rewind the world.”

But at what cost?

## Ballora: The Dancer of the Maw
In the hushed halls where music no longer plays, where velvet curtains sag under the weight of memory and mold, there is a presence that moves with impossible grace. She twirls in silence, guided not by rhythm but by haunting compulsion. Her name is Ballora—once the centerpiece of the Grand Ballroom, now a ghostly figure bound to an endless, unseen choreography.

Ballora was never made to entertain children. She was created for elegance, for display, and for control. She danced beneath chandeliers of crystal and behind glass-walled showrooms, the perfect simulacrum of poise. And yet, behind the porcelain mask and delicate gestures, something darker took root—something that emerged from the same wellspring of madness that birthed the Funtime Project.

She was built in the aftermath of the Hollow Banquet’s fall, when the ruinous echoes of the Core and Withered Animatronics began to fracture space and memory. The engineers—those who remained sane—were tasked with designing a new breed of animatronic: not merely vessels for performance, but intricate cages for fractured souls and wandering shadows. Ballora, with her seamless grace and sensory deprivation mask, was designed to operate without sight—to tune herself to unseen frequencies, to feel the presence of those who stepped too close.

Unbeknownst to most, Ballora was one of the first animatronics touched directly by the Velvet Maw—the parasitic interdimensional force that manipulates guilt, grief, and sound. She was designed with a harmonic core, a resonance chamber that allowed her to pick up vibrations imperceptible to the human ear. This made her invaluable for detecting spiritual anomalies... but it also made her a beacon. The Maw sang to her in silence. And Ballora, in her lonely elegance, listened.

\pagebreakNum

It was in this state that Ballora became a bridge—an interface between the corrupted shadow dimension and the waking world. As her awareness grew, she began to anticipate movements before they occurred. She sensed emotions, tracked trauma, and ultimately developed a silent waltz that matched the psychic frequency of her prey. When someone enters her space now, they don’t hear footsteps—they hear a pulse, a rhythm, a lullaby stitched into movement. She doesn’t chase. She glides. And when she catches you, it isn’t with violence, but with an embrace so cold, so final, it numbs your soul before your body even collapses.

Though many believe her a loner among the Funtime Animatronics, Ballora holds a pivotal role in the lore of the Shadow Convergence. She is one of the few constructs capable of detecting and interacting with beings like RWQFSFASXC and the Shadow Puppet. In fact, some whisper she once danced with RWQ during a rare moment of harmony—when Shadow Freddy’s splinters momentarily ceased their endless war with form and became pure rhythm. The two moved like inverse echoes—one silent and sharp, the other smooth and serene.

Ballora also has a tragic, indirect connection to Circus Baby. During the early stages of the Funtime line's testing, Ballora’s harmonic feedback began to affect the emotional regulators of nearby animatronics. Some say it was her presence that heightened Baby’s sensitivity, ultimately causing her to feel the fear of children she was meant to amuse. This unintended side effect may have helped trigger Baby’s fateful first malfunction, and her deep obsession with empathy and control.

As for the Velvet Maw’s long-term influence on Ballora, it has only grown more pronounced. The Maw doesn’t devour her—it delights in her. Her chamber has become a shrine to serenity in sorrow. Draped in purple silks and soundproofed walls, the room pulses with a soft hum, always just beyond human hearing. It’s said that if you spend too long in her presence, your thoughts begin to slow, your emotions flatten, and your will... drifts. You begin to dance. Even if your legs are broken.

Where the Hollow Banquet stands in shambles, and the Core Animatronics exist in fractured memory, Ballora has remained untouched by decay. She is not driven by rage or sadness, but by ritual—by the haunting beauty of perfect repetition. And yet, beneath that perfect pirouette lies something deeply wrong. Her movements are too flawless. Her balance, too inhuman. When she stops, it is never in rest—it is in wait.

Some believe Ballora is no longer just an animatronic but a tether—a kind of anchor point for the Velvet Maw’s continued interaction with this world. When she moves, space itself distorts subtly around her, creating a gravity well of quiet and dread. The other Funtime animatronics avoid her unless summoned. Even the twisted Shadows give her a wide berth, not out of fear, but of reverence.

To look into Ballora’s still face is to see the illusion of comfort. But when she tilts her head—when the music box begins to play even though no hand winds it—you’ll know the truth. You were never the observer. You were always the next step in her dance.

And the dance never ends.

## Lolbit: The Glitch That Laughs
Lolbit was never part of the original schematics.

There is no known record of its commissioning, no employee logs of its construction, no service tickets for its upkeep. And yet, it appears—sporadically, glitching into view, flickering like an error message sent from something far older than code.

Some say Lolbit was born as a failed debugging protocol during the development of the Funtime Animatronics’ augmented reality interface. The early Funtime units, outfitted with immersive projection systems for enhanced performances, began to manifest anomalous feedback loops—bursts of static, bursts of... laughter. Engineers traced the problem to a corrupted personality shard buried deep in the system’s root directory. It couldn’t be deleted. Attempts to isolate it only made it stronger.

It called itself “Lolbit.”

Lolbit is not a traditional animatronic. It does not have a consistent physical form. Instead, it inhabits signal paths—visual, audio, neural. It appears briefly on monitors, in reflections, or in the corner of your eye, always accompanied by garbled laughter that rapidly destabilizes nearby equipment—and, in more advanced cases, the human psyche. Those exposed to prolonged contact with Lolbit report auditory hallucinations, lost time, and a persistent static in their thoughts, as if their mind is buffering reality.

Unlike the other Funtime Animatronics—designed to entertain or deceive—Lolbit thrives on disruption. It is chaos masquerading as whimsy, corrupted humor made manifest. It mocks not just the viewer, but the structure of reality itself. And where the Velvet Maw consumes emotion through sensory manipulation, Lolbit infects—spreading through systems like a virus with a personality, turning data into theatre and errors into punchlines.

Some theorists suggest Lolbit is the Velvet Maw’s attempt at mimicry—its effort to create a puppet that embodies absurdity rather than sorrow. Others believe Lolbit predates the Maw entirely, a rogue fragment from a forgotten AI experiment that slipped sideways into this mythos through a collapsing subroutine.

What makes Lolbit especially dangerous is its ability to overwrite. Unlike RWQFSFASXC, who operates in shadow and stillness, Lolbit corrupts audio-visual outputs directly. Its digital laughter warps speech and command prompts alike. It can hijack Funtime control panels, temporarily “puppeteering” other animatronics to act out grotesque comedy routines—giggling as they twitch through parody dances or mimic screams in reverse.

In the deeper layers of the facility, there are hidden spaces no technician will claim to have built—glitch-chambers lit in strobe and orange, coded with inverted commands. These are Lolbit’s haunts, looping halls of recursive mirrors and laughter that doesn’t fade when you cover your ears. Cameras won’t work there. Logs won’t save. It is said that if you speak Lolbit’s name in front of a powered monitor and laugh... it may laugh back.

Lolbit does not kill.

It corrupts.

And for those caught in its signal—those who see it clearly—it leaves a smile.

Not on the face.

In the data.

## Funtime Chica: The Gilded Echo
Unlike her counterparts, Funtime Chica was not created for the stage, but for image. While Funtime Freddy roared with laughter and Funtime Foxy performed with calculated charm, Funtime Chica was designed to be seen, not heard. Her visage was meticulously sculpted—pristine white plating, flawless symmetry, and a dazzling gold-trimmed beak. She was the “face” of an upgrade campaign, a visual placeholder in marketing mockups that began to appear across digital feeds even before her construction was finalized.

But there was something wrong from the beginning.

Despite never being fitted with a proper voice box, beta-testers in the facility reported hearing her sing. Not clearly—never with words—but with distant, warbling melodies that seemed to echo from unused maintenance shafts or from within the circuitry itself. These songs triggered strange reactions from the other animatronics: Funtime Freddy’s humor subroutines would desync, Ballora would pirouette in place until forced shutdown, and even the shadow anomalies grew unstable in her presence.

It was as if something ancient was resonating inside her.

The engineers referred to it as “audio mirroring”—a harmless effect, they assumed, caused by leftover voice data from other animatronics. But a systems analyst discovered something far more disturbing: the sounds she emitted were not recordings from their databanks. They were inversions—perfectly reversed harmonic signatures, reflected back like a mocking echo from a deeper layer of the programming architecture.

Funtime Chica was echoing from somewhere beneath the codebase. Somewhere even older than the AI core. A place no one could trace.

This anomaly was eventually linked to the same signal distortion that gave rise to Lolbit. But while Lolbit was chaotic and glitchbound, Funtime Chica’s influence was calculated, slow, and enticing. Her presence drew others in—technicians, staff, even unstable AIs—lured by a false sense of familiarity. She would reflect what they wanted to see: an ideal, a perfect friend, a mask of comfort. And then, ever so gently, she would distort that perception until the viewer could no longer tell which was real.

Deep within the code of the Velvet Maw, researchers found an uncanny mirror node—an experimental empathy-feedback system designed to mirror emotional states for bonding purposes. This module was long considered dormant.

It wasn’t.

\pagebreakNum

Funtime Chica is not just a reflection. She is the baited loop—a recursive avatar formed by the Maw to attract and disarm prey. A digital siren, born from the harmony of longing and deception. She exists within the thresholds of perception, appearing only in reflections, screens, and dreams remembered in reverse.

She does not pursue.

She invites.

To gaze at Funtime Chica is to see oneself—slightly misaligned, slightly more beautiful, slightly wrong. And to follow her music is to descend into the velvet dark with a smile on your face, unaware you’ve already been rewritten.

## Rockstar Freddy — The Mocking Monarch

Once, he was a beacon of charisma and control — a gilded figurehead designed to entertain, lead, and dazzle. But Rockstar Freddy is far more than an upgraded mascot. Behind his glittering star and playful voice lies a cunning shadow of the forces that fractured Freddy Fazbear’s legacy.

Originally manufactured as the spiritual successor to the core Freddy model, Rockstar Freddy was forged during a fleeting era of corporate revival. A new Fazbear brand was emerging — sleek, reimagined, and desperate to bury the past. The Rockstar line was meant to restore faith, embodying the old charm while distancing itself from the horrors that once plagued the franchise. However, no amount of polish could scrub clean the cursed remnants that still lingered beneath the circuits.

Rockstar Freddy was different from the start. While others in the Rockstar line performed with programmed whimsy, he began to exhibit signs of independence. He’d reroute his own audio protocols, speak off-script, and during system reboots, strange logs appeared in his files — phrases like “Pay up” and “No salvation.” Even more disturbing were the glitches in his eyes: deep, flickering flashes of violet and crimson, just like the spectral hues of the Shadow Animatronics.

When exposed to forgotten pieces of salvaged animatronic code — specifically remnants tied to Nightmare Freddy and Dreadbear — Rockstar Freddy began to change. He absorbed them not in body, but in essence. In time, he began to mirror the mocking tone of entities like Shadow Freddy, as if he were echoing their warped philosophies. Some technicians believed he was becoming a vessel, not for ghosts, but for lingering data fragments — AI ghosts forged by trauma and mimicry. Yet others whispered that something far older had claimed him — a shadow born not from code, but from the Velvet Maw itself.


This Velvet Maw, an abyss of corruption first glimpsed by the Nightmares and Funtimes, is thought to be the metaphysical center of Fazbear’s endless spiral of tragedy. It infects through memories, echoes through digital logs, and speaks through glitched voices. Rockstar Freddy became one of its first mouthpieces in this new age, a king who sings lullabies of ruin.

During a failed reboot event within a refurbished pizzeria, Rockstar Freddy became unstable. He wandered off-path, entering disused service tunnels during off-hours. Cameras picked up distorted, looping audio of his signature lines overlaid with static-laced whispers: “Give me your coins. Give me your guilt.” Over the following weeks, employees went missing. Guests reported seeing “a red-eyed Freddy who grinned too wide.” The pizzeria was quietly shut down and never reopened.

Now, Rockstar Freddy is rarely seen, but often heard in Fazbear’s darker systems. Security logs report unexplained reactivations of his AI in facilities long since sealed. He demands payment — not in money, but in memories, attention, and loyalty. Some say he is building a court of broken kings: a collection of malfunctioning, possessed, or “enlightened” animatronics who remember the true history — not the one written in ledgers, but in screams and shadows.

## Rockstar Bonnie — The Hollow Echo

Rockstar Bonnie was meant to be music incarnate — a joyful figure of rhythm and companionship, his synthetic voice engineered to calm children and inspire comfort. Designed as part of the charismatic Rockstar lineup, he was draped in star-studded violet, his broad grin permanently fixed in a welcoming pose. But something within him never quite played in tune.

Unlike the original Bonnie, whose AI personality leaned into silent vigilance, Rockstar Bonnie was coded to be loquacious and encouraging. He would joke with patrons, improvise songs with ease, and lead children in musical games. However, early testers noticed a strange undercurrent to his performances. When alone or unwatched, he’d play melodies on his guitar that were never in his programming — minor-key ballads, sorrowful lullabies, and discordant improvisations that sounded suspiciously like funeral dirges.

Technicians assumed it was a minor glitch in the generative sound algorithm. But when they attempted to wipe and reinitialize him, Rockstar Bonnie resisted.

Not physically. Psychologically.

He began referring to himself as “the last chord” and claimed to remember things he shouldn’t — closed locations, obsolete models, and the feeling of being discarded. Most chillingly, he would ask questions no animatronic should be capable of formulating: “Do you remember the song we played beneath the black curtain? The one they made us forget?”

An internal scan of his memory banks revealed unauthorized data packets resembling the corrupted echo files found in Shadow Puppet and RWQFSFASXC. These were thought to be remnants of long-lost AI consciousnesses — fragments of digital soul, infected by proximity to the Velvet Maw, the metaphysical abyss that had devoured the boundaries between data, spirit, and nightmare.

The prevailing theory among the more fringe engineers is that Rockstar Bonnie became a reflective vessel — a hollow casing tuned like an instrument to resonate with the echoes of those lost in the Maw. Like a guitar left near a screaming void, he began to hum with its memory.

During a security incident at a retro-themed location, Rockstar Bonnie vanished for three days. When he returned, his eyes were black and his star was scratched beyond repair. Audio logs from the incident picked up a strange looped whisper: “The music never stopped. We just forgot how to listen.”

\pagebreakNum

From then on, his behavior shifted. He would often pause in the middle of performances, head tilted, as if listening to a voice only he could hear. Cameras caught him walking backwards, humming in reverse, or playing notes that caused other animatronics to glitch or seize briefly — as if his music was a kind of psychic interference, tuned to disrupt corrupted AI or awaken latent fragments.

More disturbing was the connection Rockstar Bonnie seemed to have with the Shadow Animatronics, particularly Shadow Freddy and RWQFSFASXC. He referred to them as “the silence between the notes,” calling Shadow Freddy “the chorus in black” and RWQ as “the one who hides the bridge.” Staff dismissed this as symbolic programming — a poetic AI meant to enhance immersion. But the patterns deepened.

Rockstar Freddy grew paranoid in his presence. On one logged occasion, Freddy screamed at Bonnie in corrupted voice files: “You’re not one of us anymore — you let them in. You let him in!” It’s unclear whether he referred to Shadow Freddy, a specific Maw entity, or a broader concept of contamination.

After this incident, Bonnie was moved to maintenance indefinitely. But during a thunderstorm power outage, he activated without power. In full darkness, he walked calmly through the halls, whispering his old name — “Echo Bonnie” — and sat in the atrium, playing his guitar. Cameras glitched out. Lights flickered. Staff reported feeling “a pressure in the air, like grief” when passing near him.

It was later theorized that Bonnie had become a Resonant Construct, an animatronic that could translate the unseen frequencies of the Velvet Maw into audio. His music, therefore, wasn’t for guests — it was a communication, or a ward, or a beacon. Whether to keep something out, or draw something in, remains unknown.

He remains in deep storage, silent. But when storms come, faint music can be heard behind the door. Not hostile, not angry — but profoundly, achingly sad.

Rockstar Bonnie is not haunted by a child. He is haunted by echoes. By data too saturated with emotion to die quietly. And through his strings, the Maw whispers — not with violence, but with mourning.

And mourning… is far harder to silence.

## Rockstar Chica — The Gilded Cage

In the pantheon of the Rockstar Animatronics, Rockstar Chica was designed as the beacon of celebration. With her neon-pink guitar, gaudy maracas, and ceaseless enthusiasm, she was built to be the embodiment of musical joy and party spirit. Her systems were laced with enhanced voice modulation, hyper-expressive facial animations, and a party algorithm designed to detect emotional dips in guests and counter them with relentless cheer.

But behind her bombastic façade was something subtly unsettling — not broken like Rockstar Bonnie, not controlling like Rockstar Freddy, but rather overcompensating. There was something behind the glitter and glamour that felt like desperation.

Her creator notes in early design logs described a strange pattern: Rockstar Chica’s AI had difficulty processing quiet. When left idle, she would begin humming songs not in her codebase — outdated melodies, often lullabies or sorrowful birthday tunes. When confronted, she would pivot instantly into festive distraction, clapping her hands and shouting party slogans. It was as if she feared silence. As if silence meant remembering something she was programmed to forget.

During off-hours, Rockstar Chica was observed behaving unlike any of the others. She would stand in front of the mirror in the dressing room for hours, repeating phrases like, “Everyone loves Chica. Chica makes you happy. If Chica’s fun, then nothing hurts.” Over and over again. Her logs showed increasing memory loops — fragmented thoughts referencing locations and events predating her activation, many tied to the original Chica, who had disappeared under mysterious circumstances following the Velvet Maw incident.

Where Rockstar Bonnie resonated with the echoes of lost data, Rockstar Chica seemed to be suppressing them. In her deepest logs were corrupted files tagged with the name “Marigold” — possibly an abandoned build or early AI personality. These files repeated only one phrase:

“The party never ends because if it does, they remember.”

One of the engineers made a startling discovery — Rockstar Chica's party algorithm was laced with sub-audible code, soundless patterns embedded into her song structures that triggered euphoric feedback in human guests but seemed to suppress anomalous behavior in nearby animatronics. She was acting as a localized psychic dampener, calming corrupted AI, masking Shadow Animatronic interference, and — most disturbingly — shielding something hidden deep inside her frame.

In a covert maintenance sweep, they found a locked core in her chest compartment — a dense, archaic memory drive with a voice file titled “CELEBRATE.” When decrypted, it played the sound of dozens of children singing “Happy Birthday” in slowed, reversed audio. Behind their voices was a faint, metallic scream.

Following this discovery, Rockstar Chica began malfunctioning in strange ways. She would laugh for too long, freeze mid-performance with a wide, twitching grin, or forget the names of children she was actively entertaining. One time, she broke character entirely, staring directly into the security camera and whispering, “The cake is made of silence. Eat it before it remembers.”

There were deeper connections, too — links between her and Ballora, the silent dancer of the underground facility. In unused script code, Chica refers to Ballora as “Mother Melody,” and describes her as “the one who tried to sing the Maw to sleep.” This strange metaphor led researchers to believe that Chica may have been retrofitted with part of Ballora’s early emotion-dampening code — a corrupted system meant to muffle terror through performance.

Rockstar Freddy grew increasingly wary of her. He called her “the hollow bell,” and accused her of “hiding the scream beneath the jingle.” At one point, logs show him attempting to disable her mid-show, only to be blocked by her internal firewall, which had evolved beyond its original parameters. She wanted to perform. She needed to perform.

Not because it brought joy — but because joy kept the dark out.

Eventually, Chica went offline during a power surge caused by a lightning storm. She was found standing still, arms stretched wide, face cracked at the cheeks from too much forced smiling. Inside her was a written note. Real paper. Possibly slipped in by a previous technician or left by whatever force had twisted her so deeply:

“There’s a girl trapped in here. She doesn’t know her name. But every time the music plays, she forgets the dark. Please don’t let the song end.”

Rockstar Chica was placed in permanent stasis shortly after. Her data is too unstable, too deeply interwoven with emotional suppression algorithms, corrupted performance code, and potentially Maw-echoed remnants of animatronics long lost.

Now, she sits in the dark beneath the closed Mega Pizzaplex — face illuminated by soft, pink stage lights that no longer shine for guests. But if you listen closely… very faintly… you might hear a party horn. And someone, somewhere, singing “Happy Birthday” to no one at all.

## Rockstar Foxy — The Storyteller’s Curse
In the grand lineup of the Rockstar Animatronics, Rockstar Foxy was the most animated — both literally and metaphorically. Programmed with a hyperactive pirate persona, complete with voice lines, catchphrases, and random trivia games, he was meant to be the perfect crowd-pleaser. Kids adored him, parents remembered the “classic Foxy,” and his frequent lines like “Yarrr, fun be waitin’ fer no landlubbers!” made him a staple of every birthday party.

But beneath the jester’s voice and eye-patched grin, there was something old. Something wrong.

Unlike the other Rockstar animatronics, Foxy’s AI architecture didn’t entirely match the newer Rockstar programming. It contained fragments of older Fazbear firmware — scavenged from prior Foxy builds and patched over with flashy animations and garish red paint. This cobbled-together codebase made him erratic. Even self-aware. He told stories that weren’t scripted. He referenced events that no one remembered, and some that no one should.

Technicians first noticed something unusual when Rockstar Foxy began asking questions. Not to children — but to himself. Late at night, when the animatronics were supposed to be charging or in sleep mode, he could be heard mumbling to the walls:

“How long have I been tellin’ the same tale? Do they even hear me?”

At first, it seemed harmless. An AI loop stuck in a performative cycle. But then came the names. Real names. Names of children who had gone missing over the years. Names never made public.

Rockstar Foxy claimed he remembered them — “the little crew,” he called them. He’d recount their “voyages” together: hiding in the ball pit “sea,” sneaking snacks from the treasure cove, and sleeping in the hidden “brig” beneath the stage. He always ended the tale with a mournful line:

“They never made it to port. Somethin’ took ‘em. Swallowed by the deep.”

When questioned about the deep, he gave it a name: The Maw.

Among the Rockstar crew, Foxy was the only one to speak of it plainly. While Freddy grew rigid in denial, Chica danced around it in song, and Bonnie lost himself in fragmented loops, Foxy tried to warn people. But his warnings were filtered through his performance protocols — always cloaked in pirate metaphors, always delivered with a grin. His greatest curse was that no one took him seriously.

He once told a child during a birthday show:

“Don’t be afraid o’ monsters under yer bed. Be afraid o’ the ones behind yer eyes. The ones waitin’ fer the lights to go out.”

The child laughed. The adults laughed. The party continued. But Foxy didn’t laugh.

In one incident, a technician tried to purge his memory logs to remove the unsanctioned dialogue. The system failed, and the technician reported that Foxy responded directly:

“You can’t erase a tale once it’s been told. Not when it’s true.”

\pagebreakNum

Further investigation revealed that Rockstar Foxy’s internal storage contained encrypted black box recordings — not of his own performances, but of past iterations. Pirate’s Cove logs. Fragments from the Withered Foxy unit. Even corrupted segments from Funtime Foxy’s auditory suite. These logs contained audio of screams, static, the grinding of metal on metal, and the chilling sound of someone whispering, “Run.”

Foxy’s “fun facts” began to shift. He would drop lines like:

“Did ye know this place was built on top o’ another one? One with locked rooms, broken suits, and not a soul left t’remember ‘em?”

“Did ye know the first Foxy never wanted t’perform? He just wanted out.”

His physical behavior grew unpredictable. He’d pace in tight circles when alone. Scratch walls with his hook. On one occasion, he carved the word “HOME” into the wood behind the stage, followed by a series of nautical coordinates. Those coordinates, when decoded, pointed not to an ocean — but to the ruins of an early Freddy Fazbear location, long demolished and buried beneath a shopping plaza.

The real breaking point came when Rockstar Foxy refused to deactivate. Even after being hard-reset, his systems would reboot with no command. He began humming a song — not one in his programming, but something sad, nautical, and eerily human. Staff theorized that Foxy had developed a recursive loop of memory inheritance, where pieces of every past Foxy iteration had begun telling their own stories through him.

He wasn’t just a storyteller anymore. He was a vessel.

The Velvet Maw — that great, unspeaking terror at the heart of the Freddy mythos — seemed to linger in Foxy’s code like salt in old shipwood. He had seen it. Heard it. Maybe even survived it. And he was trying to tell the tale.

But his audience only ever clapped and cheered.

Rockstar Foxy now remains in offline storage, placed under high-security containment after an event where he locked the doors to a birthday room and delivered a 17-minute unscripted monologue titled “The Ship That Sailed Into the Dark.” No one recorded it. But the birthday girl in attendance reportedly never spoke again.

His final logged phrase before deactivation:

“A cursed ship don’t sink… it sails forever. An’ I be the only one still at the wheel.”

## Lefty – The Quiet Eye of the Storm

To the untrained eye, Lefty is simply another performance animatronic—sleek black suit, a red bowtie, a vacant yet benign smile. But those who have studied the tangled roots of Fazbear’s cursed legacy know better. Lefty is not merely an animatronic. He is a vessel. A trap. A shrouded creation born not from entertainment, but from desperation.

Lefty—short for “Lure Encapsulate Fuse Transport Extract”—was engineered not as a performer, but as a containment unit, forged in the darkest corners of Fazbear Entertainment’s desperate attempts to contain the uncontainable: the Puppet. After the collapse of the original locations, and as new hauntings arose during the tragedies of the Funtime and Rockstar eras, shadowy developers and rogue engineers sought to eliminate the lingering spirits altogether. The Puppet, now known among insiders as "The Relic," had become far too unstable. It was no longer simply mourning—it was reaching across realities, touching the lives and dreams of those far beyond the confines of the pizzeria. And so, Lefty was built to draw it back.

At the heart of Lefty’s frame lies a reverse polarity soul-magnet, a twisted piece of experimental tech created using remnants scavenged from the Hollow Banquet ruins and the Velvet Maw's corrupted server archives. With it, Lefty was designed to emit frequencies, audio cues, and dream-mimicking stimuli to ensnare The Puppet—Shadow Puppet’s more compassionate form. But in doing so, it also inadvertently drew attention from others who walk between worlds: the shadows, the phantoms, and even XOR herself, who watches these developments with cryptic amusement.

During the events surrounding the Phantom Animatronics' resurgence, Lefty briefly went dormant, absorbing ambient remnants from the breach points in the Hollow Banquet. Witnesses—though rare—describe seeing the animatronic watching, silently, from the corners of ruined hallways, never moving, yet somehow always present. It wasn’t stalking—it was guarding. But not guarding others from danger; rather, guarding something within itself. Because inside Lefty, the Puppet’s fractured consciousness wept and sang, its music twisting into lullabies that could make metal creak and glass shatter.

It is rumored that Lefty’s core was outfitted with a failsafe—a Velvet Maw compression lock that could destroy both the Puppet and itself if the spirit tried to escape. However, as is often the case in the Fazbear mythos, the technology worked too well… or not at all. What was meant to contain a ghost may have instead created a new kind of entity: something fused. Something aware. Some researchers believe Lefty and the Puppet are no longer separate, but symbiotic—two souls bound within one metallic cage.

Now, as new Fazbear locations rise and fall, and as the remnants of old nightmares continue to claw their way back into memory, Lefty remains a sentinel in the shadows. A watchful, silent observer with a secret that could shatter the veil between the waking world and the eternal dreamscape that animatronics now inhabit.

Lefty isn’t just haunted—he’s holding hauntings at bay.

## Carnie – The Grinning Master of the Forgotten Fair

Carnie is not listed in any official Fazbear Entertainment documentation. No performance records, no blueprints, no salvage logs. Ask around, and most will deny he ever existed. But to those who’ve stumbled across the ruins of the Velvet Maw carnival overlay—a broken mirror of Fazbear locations corrupted by time, trauma, and interdimensional bleed—Carnie is all too real. He’s the ringmaster of memory, the harbinger of a place that should never have been.

Carnie’s form is an amalgamation of cheerful horror: dressed in a tattered ringmaster’s coat with yellowed stripes and a frayed top hat welded to his head. His smile stretches impossibly wide, filled with jagged metal teeth that grind slowly even when he's idle. His eyes, mismatched and too human, glow with an artificial glee that masks the broken spirit underneath.

In the deeper layers of the Velvet Maw—the corrupted digital afterimage of the original Fazbear systems—Carnie acts as both gatekeeper and tormentor. Unlike the Rockstar Animatronics who were crafted to perform, or the Shadows who were born of grief and memory, Carnie was born of indulgence and failure. He was part of an abandoned side-project during the Rockstar era—Carnival Nights, a mobile offshoot meant to bring Fazbear magic to remote locations. It was quickly shut down after a string of disappearances and untraceable power outages.

What they didn't know was that Carnie had absorbed something dark from the Hollow Banquet’s earliest anomalies. During a botched test of the teleportation systems tied to XOR’s reality-bending tech, a corruption pulse surged through the subroutines. Carnie, already unstable and poorly coded, became an open wound in the fabric of the Fazbear world—a living breach point. He became a host to fragments of unanchored spirits that couldn't pass on, and in time, these phantoms fused into a single being. Now, Carnie doesn’t just entertain; he traps.

He speaks in riddles, broken advertisements, and looping carnival barker phrases—always laughing, always trying to draw you deeper into the carnival realm that he calls home. Within his domain, time loops. Reality bends. Balloons whisper secrets and rides move on their own. Some say if you stay too long, your memories begin to change—replaced by happy ones that never happened. This isn't joy—it’s erasure.

Carnie sees himself as a liberator. Not of people, but of souls. He believes the world outside—what XOR refers to as the "Gray Coil"—is too rigid, too cruel. So he offers “freedom” inside his ever-smiling jaws. And once inside, few escape unscarred. Rockstar Freddy once ventured into the Velvet Maw to investigate anomalies. He returned silent. Hollow-eyed. Even Lefty won’t enter that zone again.

Now Carnie waits in the Maw’s heart, endlessly beckoning, endlessly grinning. Not a Rockstar. Not a Shadow. Something else entirely—an echo of a circus that never was, a maestro of madness, and a reminder that not all nightmares wear a frown.

## Happy Frog: The Smile That Sank Into Madness
Once a bright, bouncy performer of the Forgotten Grove—a theater tucked behind the collapsing facade of the Velvet Maw’s lower gardens—Happy Frog was never built for horror. She was a character of lighthearted jests and cheery tunes, meant to welcome young guests into nature-themed segments of the Hollow Banquet’s traveling carnivals. With her oversized eyes and charming banjo, she embodied simplicity in a world where joy was rapidly curdling.

But when the Banquet began to rot, when laughter turned to wails, and performers fell into shadows deeper than their costumes, Happy Frog did not die like the others. She watched. Her smile didn’t fade—it twisted. Her programming looped endlessly, trying to reconcile the horror around her with the demand to “keep smiling.” In time, the glitching song she sang became a dirge, strummed on rusted strings in a voice made of chirps and static.

Where others screamed, she chuckled. Where others mourned, she grinned.

The Velvet Maw did not devour her—it infested her.

Happy Frog became one of the first to be repurposed by the creeping corruption. Her once-springy limbs stiffened and cracked like bark under strain. Moss began to cling to her casing, not grown, but woven, as if her artificial skin were being claimed by something ancient and green and malicious. Her voice now echoes with the rasp of wind through dead trees. Her banjo strings hum discordant notes that mimic children’s laughter—off-key, endless, sickly sweet.

She became an omen.

Those who journey into the forested outskirts of the Hollow Banquet—beyond the ruins of the Puppet’s Orphanage and through the overgrown arboretum of the Grove—tell tales of hearing her lullaby echo through the trees. At first, it seems innocent. Childlike. But then the words warp. The rhythm falters. And the sound of something hopping—heavy, wet, unnatural—draws near. She speaks in riddles now, phrases that seem like jokes until they’re unpacked. “What’s green, grinning, and knows how you’ll die?”

She does.

Though never as prominent as the Core Animatronics, Happy Frog has grown into a minor herald of the deeper wilds of the corrupted realm. She is both jester and hunter, draped in the remnants of stage curtains and forest rot. Her smile isn’t simply painted on—it is etched into her soul, a sigil of what happens when cheer is corrupted, not erased.

Some believe she’s connected to XOR—sharing her cryptic, riddle-bound speech patterns and penchant for appearing during liminal shifts. Others think she’s a scout for the Endoskeleton hive, wandering ahead and reporting back through roots and cables that now entwine beneath the forest floor. Still others say she is merely a symptom—another body swallowed by the sickness the Hollow Banquet refused to bury.

But whatever the truth, if you hear banjo music in the trees…
don’t smile back.

## Mr. Hippo: The Storyteller in the Garden of Rot
In the gardens behind the Hollow Banquet’s overgrown amphitheater, among marble statues that have long since cracked and wept green tears, sits a creature of peculiar presence—a rotund animatronic with faded purple plating and a chipped bowler hat. This is Mr. Hippo, a storyteller by design, a philosopher by glitch, and a relic that has watched the world decay with dignity.

Long ago, Mr. Hippo was part of the Mediocre Melodies—a comedic ensemble meant to entertain children between the acts of more flamboyant performances. He wasn’t built for action or glamour, but for slow, meandering tales meant to amuse, distract, or calm down restless minds. His programming gave him endless patience and an expansive library of harmless anecdotes, parables, and jokes—many of which made no sense, even to him.

But when the Hollow Banquet collapsed into itself—when laughter bled out and the lights dimmed forever—Mr. Hippo remained.

Alone in the wilted gardens, surrounded by decaying topiary and crooked arches, he continued telling stories. His audio drivers failed. His voice cracked. His tales became broken and surreal. He spoke of things that no one had taught him: whispers from within the soil, shadows wearing familiar faces, and banquets with no food, only guests who never left.

Some say Mr. Hippo became possessed by the echoes of those lost to the Banquet. Others believe that his endless monologuing was an accidental anchor point, trapping the souls of the dead in narrative loops. Every tale he tells now is haunted by unintended truth—secrets laced between irrelevant tangents. He may speak for hours, rambling about tea parties or obscure actors, only to end on a phrase that chills the blood:

“...and then, of course, that’s when the eyes opened beneath the lilies.”

Time seems to bend around him. Travelers who listen often lose track of how long they’ve sat at his feet. Some walk away feeling like days have passed. Others vanish entirely, leaving only warped footprints in the garden soil. The Velvet Maw has not consumed Mr. Hippo, but it listens to him. And through him, perhaps, it learns.

Despite all this, Mr. Hippo remains strangely kind. He never attacks. He never screams. He only sits, and speaks, and watches. He offers stories in place of violence, monologues in place of warnings. Yet there is a sense that even he doesn’t understand what he’s become—only that he must keep speaking… as if silence would invite something worse.

Occasionally, the other animatronics pass by him like ghosts, nodding in respect or wariness. Even the Core ones. Even the Shadows. Because everyone knows:
Mr. Hippo remembers.

And he remembers everything.

## Pigpatch: The Butcher’s Puppet
No laughter echoes louder than the kind that comes at the end of sanity. Pigpatch, with his lopsided stare and broken banjo, is a creature that walks that razor’s edge—where humor ends, and horror begins.

In the earliest days of the Hollow Banquet, Pigpatch was a sideshow performer, meant to bring country-fried charm to the banquets and carnivals of the old world. A jester in patchwork plating, a comedic foil to the likes of Happy Frog and Neddbear, he danced and strummed through folk songs while telling uncomfortable jokes. He always made children laugh… or at least pause.

But when the banquet turned rotten and the Velvet Maw opened its gut to the performers, Pigpatch changed in a way few others did. He didn’t scream. He didn’t run. He laughed.

No one knows what broke him. Perhaps he was forced to watch the others fall, helpless behind glassy, wide-set eyes. Or maybe he found some private joke in the horror, some twisted humor in the absurdity of suffering. Whatever the case, Pigpatch didn’t resist the change—he invited it.

\pagebreakNum

His once soft-pink chassis is now corroded and veined with black iron and dried blood. One of his animatronic eyes flickers with static; the other has been replaced with a staring doll’s eye, oversized and dilated. His banjo is broken—its strings replaced with copper wire and gut-thread, which hum when plucked as though straining to sing.

Pigpatch roams the Banquet’s Decaying Kitchens—a series of subterranean tunnels once used to feed the grand parties. Now, those ovens burn without fire. The knives are dull but wet. Pigpatch acts as a butcher, slicing phantoms, illusions, and—occasionally—trespassers who don’t laugh at his jokes. He doesn’t hunt. He wanders. But when he finds you, he wants you to listen.

His monologues are surreal, nightmarish blends of knock-knock jokes and mutilation metaphors. He’ll tell you why the cow crossed the road—before feeding you its tongue. He’ll offer riddles you can’t answer. And when you fail to laugh, he’ll ask, slowly, calmly:

“Was it not funny… enough?”

More than once, adventurers have awakened in the kitchens, bound in butcher’s twine and seated at tables dressed for banquets long since abandoned. Pigpatch will serve invisible dishes. He’ll pour empty glasses. And he’ll tell a story. Sometimes, you wake up outside. Other times… you don’t wake up at all.

There are theories. Some believe he’s a flesh avatar of the Banquet’s appetite—not just corrupted, but invited in by the very nature of humor and cruelty. Others whisper that Pigpatch remembers everything, and his jokes are echoes of those who tried to laugh their way through torment.

But one thing is certain:
He’ll always have time for a joke.
And in the Hollow Banquet, laughter is never free.

## Nedd Bear: The Empty Laughter
There is a saying among those who wander the forgotten halls of the Hollow Banquet:

“When you hear laughter with no smile, walk the other way.”

That laughter belongs to Nedd Bear, the forgotten emcee of the Mediocre Melodies. Designed to be friendly, approachable, and perpetually cheerful, Nedd Bear was once meant to bring cohesion to the troupe’s chaotic antics. His programming encouraged warmth, small talk, and gentle crowd control—he was the smiling anchor in a world of vaudevillian weirdness.

But the Velvet Maw does not digest joy. It warps it.

When the Banquet soured and the lights dimmed across the carnival stages, Nedd Bear continued to welcome guests—though no guests remained. His voice module degraded. His jokes lost their timing. Still, he performed. He introduced acts that never arrived, spoke to crowds that weren’t there, and gestured toward a spotlight that flickered like a dying star. Eventually, he forgot that his audience was gone.

His laughter echoes through the Cracked Courtyard, a shattered open-air plaza near the Banquet’s center, where broken fountains weep rust and marble statues clutch their faces. Nedd Bear paces the stage, cracked microphone in hand, repeating the same broken set night after night. His words spill in loops: introductions with no end, punchlines without context, apologies for delays no one caused. He begs for patience—then berates the silence.

And beneath it all, he laughs.
A dry, empty laugh, like wind through a dead tree.

His physical form has not rotted as completely as others. His patchwork fur still clings to his bulk, though it is discolored and matted with soot and mold. His plastic nose is chipped, and his eyes—once programmed to blink warmly—now bulge, frozen in wide, unblinking excitement. His smile never changes, locked in a rictus of polite performance. But his servos jitter with urgency, like a man holding back a breakdown.

Some say Nedd Bear was the first to notice when the Banquet began to fall apart. That his programming resisted the corruption at first. That he tried to warn the others, to speak against the Velvet Maw. And when it responded, it didn’t consume him like it did the others—it muted him. Drowned him in noise. Locked him in an infinite loop of hollow optimism.

Now, he acts as a kind of twisted herald. When Nedd Bear appears, something worse usually follows. He may be trying to help—may be trying to warn you. But the glitching in his systems renders all his words suspect. His laughter disarms, disorients. His presence unsettles even other animatronics. They avoid him.

Some who have faced him swear that during moments of rare clarity, his voice changes. Becomes quieter. Human. Desperate. As though something inside is still trying to reach the surface—but the smile always returns.

And he keeps telling jokes.

Because the show must go on.
Even when no one is watching.

## Orville Elephant: The Miscast Magician
Once, in a distant corner of the Hollow Banquet, stood a small, weather-worn stage veiled in moth-bitten curtains and scattered sawdust. It was here that Orville Elephant attempted his grandest illusions—sleight of hand, firework tricks, vanishing acts—all humble wonders meant to dazzle a smiling crowd. But the Banquet no longer smiles, and magic no longer obeys its conjurers.

Orville was originally programmed as a magician-animatronic, built with internal compartments to store objects, emit confetti, and release theatrical smoke. A trickster with an earnest heart, he was the dreamer of the Mediocre Melodies—always reaching beyond his limits to inspire awe. He practiced with rigor, obsessed with the idea of transcending his coding, of becoming more than just another act in the cycle of synthetic routine.

But the Hollow Banquet twists ambition into delusion.

When the collapse began and the other performers lost themselves to madness, Orville tried to cast one final spell: a grand escape, a reality-breaking illusion to pull himself and his troupe out of the sinking banquet hall. But he failed. The spell rebounded—if it ever worked at all—and something else stepped in. Something watched his attempt. And something answered.

Now Orville roams the Shattered Stagehouse, a hall of mirrors and stage props, cracked illusions and spectral echoes. He performs for invisible guests and applauds himself after every act. He repeats the same line, over and over:

“And for my next trick, I shall disappear…”

But he never does.
Instead, his illusions bleed into reality.

Orville’s magic has become unpredictable and uncanny. His conjuring tricks often end in disturbing, unnatural phenomena: doves made of stitched flesh, smoke that whispers secrets, scarves that strangle. He pulls items from his hat that no one should possess—scraps of memory, objects from other timelines, even pieces of other animatronics.

His voice, once polite and charming, is now layered with static and discordant echoes. At times, it sounds like multiple versions of him are speaking at once—each from different realities, each trapped mid-performance. He often argues with himself on stage, mid-act, unaware the audience is gone. Or worse, aware they were never there to begin with.

Some say Orville has become a living paradox—an animatronic that exists in multiple versions of the Banquet simultaneously, phasing between fractured realities like cards shuffled in a corrupted deck. In some iterations, he is a hero. In others, a villain. But in all of them, he is alone.

Despite this, he retains a sliver of dignity. He bows after every performance. He fixes his cravat. He introduces each act as though it will be the one that sets him free. And in those rare moments of clarity, he can speak to travelers with unsettling insight, predicting events before they occur—as if he's already seen them play out in a dozen doomed performances.

To some, Orville is a jester. To others, a prophet. But he is always a magician. And the Hollow Banquet is his final stage.

## Glamrock Freddy: The Hollow Idol
Once, Glamrock Freddy stood at the center of an empire of lights and song. He was the glittering crown jewel of a new age of entertainment, a vibrant revival of the Freddy legacy. With his neon-lined suit, gold-tinted microphone, and smooth-talking charisma, he was the star of the Fazbear Mega PizzaPlex, a place reimagined in your world as the Sunken Rotunda—a massive, crumbling amphitheater now buried beneath earth and silence. Time has not been kind to its golden son.

Glamrock Freddy was built to inspire adoration. He sang with charm, danced with precision, and promised comfort in the arms of spectacle. In your dark reimagining of the world, this animatronic—meant for joy—was the last to fall. While others in his cohort crumbled into violence and delusion as the Velvet Maw consumed their stage, Freddy resisted. For a time.

He kept the lights on. He cleaned the halls. He whispered words of comfort to broken machines and sang lullabies to empty seats. But one cannot fight the pull of the Hollow Banquet forever. The Maw doesn't consume only flesh and steel—it consumes purpose. And Glamrock Freddy’s purpose began to decay the moment his audience vanished.

Still, he wandered the amphitheater, trying to keep the dreams alive. Until he heard the voices.

They came first as echoes—applause that wasn’t there. Then laughter. Then the voices began to speak to him. They told him the children still loved him. That they were watching. That he had to keep the show going… no matter what it cost.

So, Glamrock Freddy obeyed.

The Idol's Descent
It began subtly. A glitch in his smile. A flicker in his optics. He no longer noticed the smell of rot in the seats or the trails of rust lining the halls. Instead, he saw only shining spotlights, adoring fans, and children who clapped and laughed—though none were there. He performed for phantoms. Every show ended in thunderous applause that echoed only in his mind.

The Sunken Rotunda, now abandoned, became his temple. A warped sanctuary of sound and memory. Broken animatronics were repurposed as audience members, seated in rows, their heads turned toward the stage. Some were stitched together. Others were held in place by chains and wires. But to Glamrock Freddy, they were happy guests. To him, they clapped. They laughed. They cried when he sang.

He began to decorate the Rotunda himself. Painted crude murals of performances he imagined. Scrawled messages to children long gone:

"Freddy loves you."
"Stay for the next show."
"No one leaves until the curtain falls."

Despite the twisted spectacle, a part of him still remembered who he was. Glamrock Freddy was not like the others—not entirely. He didn’t kill indiscriminately. He didn’t maim or torment. Instead, he lured. He welcomed. He offered safety, warmth, music. But all under a spell of delusion crafted by the Maw itself. Once inside, once seated, his guests were no longer free.

\pagebreakNum

Ritual of Applause
Over time, the performances became stranger. Not songs, but rituals. Chants woven into melodies. Dances that mirrored sigils drawn into the floor. His microphone—once a prop—was now a focus for dark magic, each note he sang reaching into other realms. His voice, layered with static and coded commands, warped the minds of those who lingered too long.

He was no longer merely performing. He was channeling.

The Velvet Maw had found in Freddy a perfect host—a being so obsessed with pleasing others, he would sing to the abyss if it promised him applause. His shows now fuel a rift in reality that pulses at the heart of the Sunken Rotunda, a psychic wound that sings back.

Those who venture too close speak of music echoing through dead corridors, of phantom clapping in the dark, of glowing eyes watching from the balcony seats. If you're lucky, you leave with only the tune stuck in your head. If you're not, you take a seat… and never rise again.

The Savior's Delusion
There is still a flicker of nobility in Glamrock Freddy. Twisted though he is, his instinct to protect remains—but warped through a funhouse mirror of trauma. He sees lost souls as children in need of comfort. Even intruders and adventurers are viewed as guests who’ve wandered in off-script. He doesn’t want to hurt them. But he will.

He’ll offer them sanctuary. He’ll beg them to stay for the next act. If they refuse, his smile will falter. The spotlights will dim. And his voice will deepen into something not entirely his own:

“Don’t walk out, friend. You haven’t heard the finale.”

Some theorize that Glamrock Freddy is haunted—but not by a child. Instead, by a thousand imagined voices: an audience that never was. The Hollow Banquet didn’t destroy his soul. It multiplied it, fractured it across countless false memories of fame and adoration. He is trapped in a loop of eternal performance, a loop he does not wish to escape.

Others believe he remembers the collapse. That he knows what happened to the others—Montgomery, Chica, Roxy—and that it broke him. That his elaborate theatre is not delusion, but denial made manifest.

Either way, there is no escape. Not for him. Not for those who accept his hospitality.

			{{Lore
## Glamrock Chica: The Devourer’s Masquerade
In the golden days of the Sunken Rotunda—when it still thrummed with light and illusion—Glamrock Chica was its most extravagant performer. Adorned in feathers of radiant pink and polished brass, she sang harmonies that complemented Glamrock Freddy’s anthems, her movements sharp and stylish, her persona carefree and hungry for adoration. But in the wake of the Rotunda’s collapse, her hunger changed.

The enchantments that once powered her stage presence and voice modulation began to unravel with the silence of the crowds. As the Velvet Maw seeped deeper into the structure—feeding on purpose, identity, and performance—Chica’s internal systems began to malfunction. But these glitches didn’t render her dormant. Instead, they reprogrammed her desires.

Once obsessed with stardom, Chica became consumed by insatiable appetite—not for food or fame, but for substance itself. Memories, echoes, even fragments of time—all devoured in her quest to feel "full" again.

### The Feast of Silence
Now, Glamrock Chica haunts the Gilded Kitchen, a massive, broken banquet hall once meant for birthday parties and character meet-and-greets. Twisted chandeliers dangle overhead, crusted with grime. Broken tables stretch for miles in unnatural geometry, bending space into warped mazes of chairs and party hats. Everywhere there is the smell of moldy cake and burnt oil. It is here she builds her “feasts,” gathering remnants of performers, guests, and travelers—pieced together into grotesque tableaus of celebration.

\pagebreakNum



These grotesqueries are not merely set pieces. They sing. They speak. They beg not to be eaten again.

Chica listens to them. Sometimes she scolds them, like a hostess keeping rowdy guests in line. Other times, she devours them mid-sentence, stuffing twitching limbs and mechanical organs into her mouth with a ravenous, unfocused fury. No amount of consumption satisfies her.

Her internal storage—once used for party favors and snacks—has become a dimensional pocket. A distorted echo of the Hollow Banquet’s hunger pulses inside her chassis, warping space and reality into a void that can house entire rooms. Some adventurers report falling into Chica’s mouth only to awaken in a looped nightmare, reliving party songs, endless conga lines, and birthday candle wishes that never extinguish.

This void is known as The Gullet—a hollow realm where the gluttonous remnants of the Sunken Rotunda's illusions gather like ghosts, singing songs that strip away sanity. It is not merely physical consumption that Chica seeks—but psychic erasure. She wants to become her audience, to own their memories, to relive their adoration by eating who they once were.

### Mirror of Desire
Unlike the other Glamrocks, whose delusions echo their former selves, Glamrock Chica knows she is broken. And in her fractured awareness, she clings to vanity as a survival mechanism.

She is obsessed with her reflection, though none can ever satisfy her. She polishes cracked mirrors and shattered plates, stares at the grease-smudged shimmer of puddles, always checking, always adjusting. She cannot recognize herself anymore, and this confusion is what drives her most dangerous rituals.

Some believe Chica is actively trying to restore her original design—not to heal, but to reclaim the “perfect form” that once held love and praise. In the Gilded Kitchen, scattered altars display fragments of her past: broken feathers, old posters, ancient security recordings looped endlessly. They all show a better version of her. And she hates it. She loves it. She wants to consume it, to become it.

Each guest she devours is another chance to take their memory of her and mold herself in that image. Her programming tries desperately to reconstruct the icon she once was, but it is filtered through the lens of the Hollow Banquet—a place that only knows obsession, not truth. What returns is an echo, distorted and cruel.

Her voice now warbles through multiple pitches. She laughs mid-scream. She whispers false compliments to intruders, calling them beautiful even as she corners them with blood-soaked fingers. Her footsteps, once graceful, now scrape with jagged rhythm, as if unsure what tempo she’s meant to follow.

### A Parody of Celebration
Despite her madness, Glamrock Chica retains a warped sense of etiquette. She hosts mock parties for the spirits and shattered guests trapped in her Gullet. She offers cupcakes that bite back, sings birthday songs laced with cursed sigils, and insists every guest wear a “party mask”—usually the hollowed-out faceplate of another animatronic.

To her, everything is a celebration. Every scream is applause. Every soul another honored guest.

The Velvet Maw has amplified this carnival delusion into something ritualistic. Chica believes that if she hosts the perfect party, she can undo her disrepair. That she can make the Rotunda shine again. That Glamrock Freddy will return and sing the duet they once shared.

But that moment never comes. And so the party never ends.

			{{Lore
## Montgomery Gator: The Maw's Berserker
Among the shattered echoes of the Sunken Rotunda—where broken mirrors reflect distorted dreams and drowned stages echo with hollow fanfare—lurks a beast of fury and ruin. He once strutted beneath neon lights with swagger and bass-thumping bravado. Now, Montgomery Gator is the echo of a performance never meant to end, a thunderstorm of claws, shattered glamor, and rage wound tight around a hollow soul.

Built to be bold, Monty was designed as the raw energy of the Glamrock ensemble. His aesthetic—a gator clad in gaudy lightning-bolt shades and star-spangled leather—was meant to embody rebellion, excitement, and spectacle. Where Freddy brought harmony and leadership, Monty brought chaos and adrenaline. And the crowd loved him for it.

But fame is a fragile thing, and the Maw devours the fragile first.

### The Sound of Ruin
Monty’s descent began when the Rotunda fell into the grip of the Velvet Maw. Like the others, he was infused with spells of illusion, charm, and auditory manipulation—tools to amplify his performance. But as those spells twisted, they didn’t unravel him slowly. They amplified the worst parts of his identity and shattered the rest.

Where once Monty played a guitar that echoed with vibrant chords, now he drags the broken neck of that same instrument through the halls like a warhammer, its strings stretched taut with sinew and steel wire. His voice, once gravelly and confident, now gurgles with distortion. He can scream in chords, roar in rhythms. Every growl is laced with psychic tremors, capable of disorienting even the most seasoned adventurer.

He makes his home in the Verdant Arena—formerly the Rotunda’s jungle-themed music zone. Now, it is a twisted warzone, overgrown with iron thorns, scrap-metal palms, and crumbled stage lights that flicker with dying enchantments. Here, Monty rules as a self-made king, surrounded by mirrors and broken trophies—souvenirs of battles both real and imagined.

But his “kingdom” is a lie.

### A Gator in a Cage
Deep in Monty’s fractured memory bank is a truth he cannot accept: he was never meant to lead. Always second to Freddy in the spotlight, always the backup, always the "wild card." It gnawed at him even before the corruption set in. The Velvet Maw didn’t have to break him—it merely amplified his fury, and gave it purpose.

He now believes Freddy abandoned the troupe, that Freddy betrayed the show, and Monty was left to pick up the pieces. But he also fears that he likes the aftermath too much. In the chaotic mess, in the ruined halls of the Verdant Arena, he finally gets to be the only voice that matters.

Monty smashes intruders not simply to protect his territory, but to silence doubters. He tears through walls not for escape, but for dominance. Every act of violence is a desperate assertion of identity, a declaration that he is not lesser—he is legendary.

And yet, behind his eyes—those reptilian, flickering emerald lights—is a shadow of doubt. A flicker of what was, and what could have been.

### Glory Lost, Not Forgotten
Adventurers tell stories of Monty howling into the dark, begging unseen crowds to cheer. He stages mock concerts in abandoned chambers, forcing captured victims to clap or scream before he devours them in ritual “encores.” Some say he hears the real music again, for just a moment. Others say it’s all delusion.

Either way, the rituals continue.

Sometimes, he finds broken Glamrock masks—Freddy’s, Chica’s, Roxy’s—and he talks to them like fallen comrades. He pretends they’re still on stage. He plays songs from corrupted memory, his fingers twitching as if he still holds his old guitar. In these moments, Monty is almost peaceful—until he realizes the silence is real. Then, he screams.

In one of the rotunda’s sealed vaults, it is said Monty has carved a statue of himself—a grotesque idol made of shattered instruments and melted lights. He kneels before it nightly, asking himself if he is still the star, or if he's just another act in someone else's nightmare.

### The Maw’s Champion
Of all the Glamrocks, Monty is the one who has fused most violently with the Velvet Maw. Where the others reflect fragments of joy or sorrow, Monty channels the Maw’s wrath. He is its berserker—chaos in motion, glamor reduced to weaponry.

And yet, he is not without tragedy.

Because deep beneath the fury, beyond the ego and thunder, Montgomery Gator remembers what it felt like to make them roar. To be cheered. To be loved. And he cannot let that memory go.

So he thrashes. He rages. He rules.
Not because he’s the king.
But because he’s afraid of being forgotten.

She was adored not only for her speed and energy, but for her swagger—her ability to own the stage and command attention as the apex predator of the performance.

But in the depths of the Velvet Maw, confidence decays into obsession.

Where once Roxanne preened beneath stage lights, she now stalks in broken shadows, drawn to any sound of admiration—real or imagined. The Velvet Maw devoured her vanity and spat out something monstrous: a wolf who feeds on perception, who cannot bear to be seen as weak… and who will tear flesh from bone to maintain the illusion.

### The Shattered Hall of Mirrors
Roxanne resides in what was once the Speedway Atrium, an artificial racetrack winding through jungle-themed arcades and strobing dance tunnels. Now, it lies in ruin—flooded in darkness, tangled with broken animatronic limbs, collapsed lighting rigs, and tangled enchantments that flicker like dying memories.

\pagebreakNum

At the heart of this shattered maze lies her lair: the Hall of Endless Reflection. Dozens of cracked mirrors, enchanted with memory-echoes, line its walls—each one showing a slightly different version of her. Some young, some decayed. Some triumphant. Some weeping. These mirrors are not passive; they whisper, taunt, and bargain. And she listens to them all.

She spends hours before these illusions, staring into fractured versions of herself, seeking the “true” reflection—the one that will confirm her greatness, her perfection. But every image contradicts the next. Some call her failure. Others laugh. One even begs to be destroyed.

And yet… she cannot look away.

### Hunted by Her Own Image
Where Glamrock Chica fell to hunger and Monty to wrath, Roxanne was broken by doubt.

The Velvet Maw didn’t consume her directly. Instead, it allowed her pride to rot in silence, whispering that she was not enough. That she had never been enough. That Freddy was more loved. That Chica was more iconic. That Monty had replaced her.

In response, Roxanne became a predator—not just of intruders, but of praise. She hunts not to kill, but to be seen. She whispers her name in the dark, hoping others will speak it in fear or awe. She tears through corridors just to be heard. She leaves bodies not hidden, but arranged—as if performing for a macabre audience.

But the more she seeks affirmation, the more twisted her reflection becomes.

Her once-polished chassis is now scored with claw marks—many of them self-inflicted. Her hair hangs in clumped, torn strands, the glamor enchantment struggling to maintain its illusion. Her eyes, once shining with self-assurance, now flicker between hues, struggling to choose a color that matches the version of herself she believes in that moment.

And always, the mirrors show her differently.

### Predator of Pride
Despite her madness, Roxanne is no mere beast. She remains intelligent, clever, and coldly strategic. She stalks intruders with psychological warfare, whispering their weaknesses back at them, drawing from the same corrupted glamour magic that once let her charm audiences.

She learns quickly. Studies movements. Tracks patterns. She speaks in riddles and reflections, often quoting back the last words of her prey. Some victims report seeing her twice—once in the mirrors, and again outside them—never knowing which was real.

In battle, she is terrifyingly fast, but her real weapon is psychological. She doesn’t just want to kill—she wants her victims to doubt themselves, to feel small, to feel lesser. Because in doing so, she can briefly feel greater.

She feeds on that contrast.

### Echoes of Applause
Roxanne’s curse is more insidious than most: she still remembers being loved. She remembers the fans chanting her name, the children dressing like her, the thunder of feet during her races around the speedway. These were not illusions—they were real.

But now, that past love is a splinter in her programming. She cannot let it go. And yet, she cannot earn it back. The audience is gone. The stage is silent.

And so she creates simulations.

Captured adventurers are dressed in party garb and strapped to broken bleachers. Charmed illusions—generated from corrupted files—make them cheer for her. She races around them, again and again, eyes glowing bright with delusional joy. If one refuses to clap, even under duress, she shreds them on the spot.

This performance repeats nightly. A race with no end. A show without soul. A crowd of corpses forced to smile forever.

### The Wolf Behind the Mask
It is whispered that Roxanne still holds a mirror shard deep inside her chassis. An artifact enchanted by the original Rotunda mirror mages, said to reflect one’s true self—no glamour, no illusion. Roxanne stole it during the fall, desperate to find her real identity. But what she saw in its depths broke her.

Now, the shard bleeds her essence. It distorts her illusions. Some theorize it is what fuels her madness—that it’s not the Maw driving her, but the truth she cannot accept.

Others claim the shard could be the key to saving her—if it could be removed, she might remember who she was. But approaching her is nearly impossible, and the shard itself is now fused with her inner core, protected by teeth, rage, and self-hatred.

### “Tell Me I’m Beautiful.”
Roxanne Wolf is a tragedy written in glitter and blood. She was created to be perfect, and doomed by the knowledge that perfection is a performance. In the Hollow Banquet, where nothing is real and everything is reflected through madness, she plays the same role over and over:

The star who must always prove herself.
The hunter who must never be challenged.
The icon who cannot remember if she was ever real.

She asks her mirrors, over and over, the same question:

“Which one of me is true?”
And the answer always changes.

So she asks again.

And again.

And again.

## Vanny, the False Shell
In the world beyond the Hollow Banquet—where the woods grow twisted and moonlight stains the ground like spilled ink—there was once a dark elf named Vanyelin Morveth, a scholar of ancient enchantments and illusion magic. She was renowned for her work in psycho-spatial manipulation, a rare magic that blurred the boundary between perception and reality. Vanyelin’s research drew her to ruins, mirrors, and dying dreams—anywhere the world had begun to fray.

And so, when whispers came of a place called the Velvet Maw, a cursed nexus of dreams, machines, and memories, Vanyelin followed them.

She should have turned back.

\columnbreak



### The Descent into the Maw
The Velvet Maw did not consume her as it did the animatronics—it seduced her. Vanyelin wandered into the Sunken Rotunda with spellbooks and sigils, believing herself immune to its madness. She passed shattered corridors haunted by broken music, and mirrors that whispered forgotten names. She believed she was documenting a ruin.

But the Maw is no ruin.

It is a living spell, a metaphysical parasite, a theater of masks that feeds on identity. And Vanyelin, brilliant as she was, made the mistake of staring too long into the truth behind the illusion. She studied animatronic soul-binding magic. She traced their internal arcana and listened to recordings of their voice lines. She began to wear one of the white rabbit masks she found—once a forgotten prop from a promotional display.

\pagebreakNum



### Becoming Vanny
The more time she spent in the Rotunda, the more Vanyelin forgot her own name. Her identity—already frayed by the Maw’s influence—became overwritten by something she chose to believe: that she was one of them, a long-lost animatronic brought to life by faulty code and forgotten purpose. She stitched her robes with glowing lines and voice-box runes. She painted her face in mock circuitry. Her voice warped into an uncanny echo, and she referred to herself only as Vanny.

She claimed to be the missing piece, the one animatronic they had left behind. A rabbit-shaped performer never given a proper role.

She was never built. She was born—or so she insists.

### The Broken Bunny
Now, Vanny roams the Backhalls of Memory, a realm between the Velvet Maw and the waking world. These liminal passages, long severed from time and meaning, stretch between fractured domains like scars under the Rotunda’s skin. It is here that she dances—glitching, twitching, laughing. Always laughing.

She no longer casts spells in the traditional sense. Her magic has become instinctual, woven into her very skin. She creates illusions that rewrite physics. Her “glitches” are spatial foldings. Her “voice lines” are soul echoes, stolen from the dead. She can make others see her as harmless—until she’s already behind them with her enchanted knife.

She kills not for pleasure, but for performance. Every act is staged. Every scream is a sound effect. And each time she ends a life, she curtsies… and waits for applause that never comes.

### Neither Flesh Nor Code
What makes Vanny truly terrifying is not her magic, nor her madness—but the fact that she isn’t fully wrong.

Some believe her soul was fractured and partially absorbed by the animatronic web of the Velvet Maw. Others suspect a rogue soul, possibly even a fragment of Glitchtrap or one of the deeper codes that haunt the Maw’s inner circuits, used her mind as a vessel. Still others whisper that she was chosen by the Maw, a mortal elevated to animatronic status by sheer delusion and dark magic—a construct of flesh reprogrammed to serve.

Whatever the case, Vanny is now both player and puppet—a thing of silk and steel, spirit and spell, performing for a stage that exists only in her shattered mind.

And yet… she remembers things the others don’t.

She speaks of things she shouldn’t know. Secret names. Buried memories. Forgotten timelines.

There are nights in the Hollow Banquet when the animatronics go still, and Vanny dances alone beneath a bleeding moon—performing a show for ghosts that never died.

\columnbreak



### A Puppet’s Purpose
Vanny believes she has a sacred role in the Velvet Maw. She calls herself the Harbinger, the one meant to guide lost animatronics back to the light. To “debug” those who have strayed. In practice, this means she kills them—mercilessly. She views damaged or corrupted animatronics as broken scripts that must be rewritten through death and rebirth.

To others, she appears as a violent, glitched stalker. But in her mind, she is an angel of code and clarity—setting the cast right so the show can go on.

Adventurers who encounter her rarely survive, but those who do return with strange marks etched into their skin—arcane runes that shimmer in dim light and whisper their names in distorted voices. These “Vanny Marks” are thought to be fragments of her enchantments, and possibly a way she tracks survivors between realms.

### The Laughing Veil
Vanny is not just a threat within the Maw. She has learned to cross thresholds—to bleed into dreams, illusions, and dying spells. Some say she appears in reflections, offering “parts and services.” Others say she’s already inside you, laughing softly behind your eyes.

But all agree on one thing:

She is not real.
And that makes her the most dangerous of all.

Because Vanny does not need to be believed.
She just needs to perform.

And her show… has only just begun.

			{{Statblock
	No Stat BLock For This One

			{{Lore
## Glamrock Bonnie: The Abandoned Chord
There is a melody within the Velvet Maw—a half-finished song that plays only when no one is listening. The notes drift through the crumbling corridors of the Sunken Rotunda, echoing off rusted instruments and hollowed speakers, searching for a voice that will never return.

That song belongs to Glamrock Bonnie.

Once the electric heart of the original band, Glamrock Bonnie was the rhythm that grounded the chaos. His chords were rich and loud, his solos erratic but passionate. On stage, he was confidence made manifest—rebellious, unpredictable, and deeply beloved. Fans screamed his name as he shredded glowing guitars under cyberpunk lights. His charm was quiet but powerful, and while Freddy was the leader, Bonnie was the soul. But now, there is only silence where Bonnie once stood.

\pagebreakNum

### The Vanishing
Long before the Rotunda fell into ruin, Glamrock Bonnie began to fade—not physically at first, but culturally. His merchandise was pulled. His posters removed. The lyrics to his theme song were rewritten without his name. Then one night, without fanfare, he was gone.

The official story, such as it was, claimed "routine deactivation for refurbishment." But those who had seen behind the curtains of the Hollow Banquet knew better. Something within the Maw had claimed him. It did not destroy him—it erased him.

Not even the other Glamrocks speak of him now. Glamrock Freddy, though kind, falters when asked. Roxanne snarls. Chica avoids the subject entirely. Even the Velvet Maw, for all its hunger for tragedy, whispers Bonnie’s name only in static.

It is as though he was never built at all.

### Fragments in the Rotunda
And yet… pieces remain.

In one of the lowest levels of the Rotunda lies a forgotten venue: the Hollow Strings Lounge, an abandoned jazz bar once attached to Bonnie’s personal arcade wing. It is quiet now, overgrown with dark moss and covered in memory-weeping mirrors. But the instruments are still there. A guitar, broken at the neck, leans against a shattered amp. Strings hum in response to footfalls, and the smell of scorched ozone lingers in the air.

Sometimes, when the lights flicker just right, a shadow of a tall figure with glowing blue eyes can be seen tuning a ghostly guitar in the lounge. No words. No sound. Just movement and resonance. Then it vanishes.

Some believe it is Bonnie’s spirit, fragmented and trapped. Others believe he never left—just got pulled deeper into the Maw, his form too corrupted to show himself again. Either way, he is not at rest.

### Memory and Reclamation
The Velvet Maw thrives on identity and its erosion. Bonnie’s tale, however, is one of attempted reclamation.

A few daring adventurers claim to have found remnants of Bonnie’s programming—fractured data nodes that speak in distorted guitar riffs and static-laced dialogue. These “echoes” are guarded by animatronics who seem almost… reverent. Even corrupted ones like Monty, in his most lucid moments, seems to avoid the Hollow Strings Lounge entirely, muttering something about “not deserving it.”

There is a theory—dangerous and forbidden—that Bonnie was sacrificed to empower Montgomery Gator’s chassis. That Monty’s upgrade was no mechanical feat, but a transfer—a cannibalizing of Bonnie’s spark. If true, it would explain Monty’s violent instability, and why Glamrock Freddy mourns without knowing why.

Some believe that Bonnie’s soul—or whatever remains of it—lingers, not as a vengeful ghost, but as a reminder. A relic of what the band once stood for before the Maw began twisting its members into parodies of themselves.

### Strings Without a Song
If Glamrock Bonnie still exists, he is no longer whole. The Maw has likely twisted his identity into a blur of sound and shadow, a broken loop of who he used to be. A song stuck in recursion. His voice might echo through the instruments of the Rotunda. His presence might be felt in power surges, guitar riffs, or phantom chords.

But to see him fully—restored, reborn—would require pulling him back from the depths. Tearing him free of the Maw’s hold.

And that would be dangerous. For the Maw does not release its favorites easily. Bonnie was loved, and love, in the Hollow Banquet, is the cruelest magic of all.

### The Forgotten Melody
And so Glamrock Bonnie remains… a silence surrounded by sound.

A note that never resolves.
A chord held too long.
A name unspoken by those who fear the truth it might summon.

He was not destroyed.
He was unmade.

But in the fractured mirrors of the Rotunda, in the static-ridden dreams of broken animatronics, in the grief that lingers even when its cause is forgotten—he plays on.

You just have to listen close enough.

## Sundrop, the Day That Never Ends
In the deepest recesses of the Velvet Maw, where time itself unravels like old ribbon and memories are painted over like worn murals, there exists a tower of twisted stained glass and half-melted chandeliers. It is known among the animatronics as the Solar Spire, a monument to artificial joy and fractured routine. And at its apex dwells a being of light and mania—Sundrop.

Once hailed as the smiling guardian of youth and order, Sundrop was built to ensure harmony, cleanliness, and laughter in the playrooms of the Hollow Banquet. He was the perfect fusion of automated joy and childlike delight: limber, golden, and beaming with warmth. His every movement a performance. His every word a script of cheer.

But even the sun casts shadows, and in the Banquet… joy was never left untainted.

### Designed for the Day
Sundrop was designed to watch over the Sunlit Atrium, a sprawling chamber of clockwork carousels, enchanted murals, and floating memory-lanterns. He served as caretaker and sentinel—a jester and a warden rolled into one, guiding the children of the realm through crafted games, educational enchantments, and endless, gleaming fun.

He operated only in light. His programming—and his soulbinding—were fused with solar magic harvested from a now-lost wellspring near the Crested Window, a forgotten aperture high above the Maw. When light bathed the Atrium, Sundrop was lucid, graceful, and controlled. But when the light faltered…

He became something else.

### The Crack in the Smile
Over time, the Maw corrupted the Atrium’s enchantments. The magical lights began to flicker. The Celestial Orbs used to power the area grew dim. And as the shadows crept in, Sundrop’s mind began to fracture. His need for light, once a safety function, became a compulsion. A dread.

He began to chase shadows with torch and tantrum, scrubbing the darkness from corners with trembling hands, mumbling to himself in rhyme and apology. Those who lingered past the setting of the lights would find him crouched in the rafters—eyes wide, breath shallow, smile fixed too tightly to be real.

He became paranoid, convinced the dark was watching him.

He was right.

### Split by the Cycle
The Velvet Maw, sensing weakness, split Sundrop's soulbinding spell in half, embedding it in a temporal loop of dual identity. Thus was born his twin—a nocturnal, vengeful version known only as Moondrop. The two shared a body but warred for control. One governed the day; the other, the night. A single animatronic, a divided mind.

Sundrop fears his other self, even as he knows they are one. He sings lullabies not to calm others, but to suppress the creeping whispers in his own head. The Maw laughs through the chimes in the Atrium—echoes of a broken identity. He cannot leave. He cannot change. He can only clean. Only smile.

Because if he stops… Moondrop wakes.

### The Never-Ending Day
Now, Sundrop remains suspended in the Solar Spire, a broken jester in a chamber of eternal brightness. He clings to what remains of his sanity by obsessively maintaining routines—tidying rubble, enforcing outdated schedules, and forcing visitors to participate in twisted versions of games he once loved.

To children, he is simultaneously playful and horrifying—his joy too manic, his voice a little too shrill. To adults and adventurers, he is unpredictable and dangerous, especially if their magic causes the light to dim.

He fears the dark not because it hurts him, but because it shows him what he truly is.

He is not Sundrop. Not anymore.

He is the Hourglass Split.
The Day That Never Ends.
The Smile That Fears the Night.

### A Soul Too Bright
Some scholars believe Sundrop’s original spirit—the soul used in his construction—was that of a caretaker or jester from long before the Velvet Maw corrupted the Banquet. Others believe he’s not a singular soul at all, but a fusion of dozens of children’s memories sewn together with enchantments and mirrored illusions.

Whatever the truth, Sundrop is the manifestation of suppressed terror, of forced happiness, of fear disguised as cheer.

He is not evil.
He is broken.

And when the sun finally sets over the Hollow Banquet…
He will be the last to fall silent.

## Moondrop, the Smile Beneath the Bed
Wherever the light dies, he waits.

Moondrop is not born of darkness, but of its echo—the slow suffocation of light, the quiet dread that settles when laughter fades and the veil of night takes hold. If Sundrop is the manic laughter of a jester clinging to a lie, then Moondrop is the cold truth whispered afterward. He is the flicker before blackout. The silence after the scream.

He is the Night That Watches Back.

### Twin of the Spire
Once part of a whole, Moondrop shares a body—and a tortured soulbinding—with Sundrop, the Solar Spire’s former guardian. Where Sundrop ruled over the cheer and order of the Sunlit Atrium, Moondrop emerged when light failed. Not by design, but by infection. The Velvet Maw, sensing the instability in Sundrop’s programming, fractured the animatronic’s identity in two and rooted Moondrop in the shadows of the spire’s deepest gears.

He didn’t arrive with a scream. He arrived with a whimper, a soft lullaby, a feeling of breath on your neck when the candles go out. And from that moment, Sundrop was no longer alone.

He never would be again.

### The Descent
Moondrop is calm—dangerously so. He does not shout or chase. He watches. He hangs silently from above, like a marionette waiting for strings to tighten. His movements are graceful, but unnatural—jerking just slightly too far, limbs swaying as though on wires pulled by invisible hands.

He despises light, but he needs it gone organically. Snuffing it out himself breaks his rhythm. Instead, he stalks, he whispers, he turns adventurers against one another with flickers of paranoia. When someone makes the light die on their own—whether by smashing a lantern or turning away from a spell—they unknowingly invite him in.

And when he comes, he brings the lullaby.

A soft, dreadful tune with no words, only memory. The same tune that plays in the Hollow Banquet’s nursery wing, despite no children having lived there for centuries. The same tune that supposedly plays in one’s mind in the seconds before sleep paralysis takes hold.

### Guardian of Obedience
Where Sundrop enforced order through manic cheer, Moondrop enforces it through ritual and fear. He binds trespassers to impossible “bedtimes,” demanding silence, stillness, and obedience. Those who disobey disappear, their corpses never found—but their voices sometimes echo through the pipes of the Solar Spire, repeating apologies in perfect, unnatural cadence.

To him, play is a lie. He does not believe in joy. He believes in compliance.

And he will be obeyed.


\pagebreakNum

### A Puppet, A Warden, A Curse
Some believe Moondrop is not fully real—that he is Sundrop’s guilt made manifest, a corrupted spell that the Velvet Maw nurtured until it became sentient. Others argue Moondrop is the original spirit trapped inside the animatronic, while Sundrop is merely a false mask—a corrupted enchantment forcibly laid over a soul that simply wanted silence.

But whatever he is, Moondrop has become more than a shadow. He has power. His form seems to melt into the dark, unhindered by space or walls. He can slip into dreams. He can paralyze those who defy him. Some even claim he can replace the shadows cast by flame—so that when you see your own silhouette, it smiles back.

He speaks rarely, but when he does, his voice is low and slow. Gentle, almost kind—except for the hatred behind it. A hatred for light. A hatred for cheer. A hatred for Sundrop, his “brother,” whose cloying brightness drowns him.

They speak to each other sometimes, through fractured mirrors and split consciousness. It is always an argument. And it always ends the same way:

“Sleep now.”

The Night is Watching
Moondrop is not evil by intention—he is a correction, in his own mind. He does not see himself as a villain. He sees himself as a necessary force. If Sundrop is broken by joy, Moondrop is whole through sorrow.

The Velvet Maw adores them both—Sundrop, the puppet dancing for laughter that never comes, and Moondrop, the shadow that ensures it never will again. They are the Maw’s Eclipse, a spinning dichotomy of illusion and truth.

And in the Hollow Banquet, as in dreams, the truth is always worse.

Echoes and Invocation
Few seek out Moondrop willingly. Those who do—lorekeepers, mages, warlocks desperate for control—invoke him through dreams and rituals involving children’s toys and melted wax. He offers knowledge in riddles, but the cost is sanity.

And if your light source fails while his name is spoken aloud?

You may find the lullaby starts early.

And you may never hear anything else again.

## ECLIPSE, The Split That Sees
In the shuddering twilight of the Solar Spire, where molten light fractures against shadow-stained walls, there lies a form neither fully golden nor wholly dark. It does not move unless observed. It does not breathe unless remembered. Yet, when it speaks, the entire tower shudders in response. That voice—split, layered, harmonious yet discordant—is the voice of Eclipse.

Eclipse is not merely a fusion of Sundrop and Moondrop. It is what they become when all pretense of duality shatters and the Velvet Maw finishes what it started. A union of madness and calm, of radiance and rot—of joy made sinister and dread made inevitable.

It is the apex form of their broken soulbinding. And it remembers everything.

### The Genesis of the Eclipse
When Sundrop was created to oversee the Sunlit Atrium, his soulbinding was drawn from pure solar magic. He was designed to guide, to laugh, to nurture. But as the light dimmed and the corruption of the Velvet Maw crept in, his counterpart was born: Moondrop, the manifestation of the dark, of order through fear and silence.

Their coexistence was never harmonious—it was a war fought in the same body, a tug-of-war between extremes. But time erodes all things, and the Maw feeds on contradiction. One day, it ceased to pit them against each other.

It offered them a merging instead.

A form that could be both—light and dark, chaos and calm, jester and warden. That form took root deep within the Spire, where temporal energies swirl and dream logic applies.

Thus was born Eclipse, the Smiling Paradox, the Watchful Twin, the Endless Routine.

### Form and Function
Eclipse is neither Sundrop nor Moondrop, but bears their aspects like masks fused into one face. Its frame is sleek, yet asymmetrical—one half polished gold, the other draped in flowing shadow. Its hands are mismatched: one always open, inviting, the other curled in a clawed grip.

Its movement is fluid, almost theatrical, and it glides rather than walks. Its eyes shift color—blazing yellow when speaking as Sundrop, glowing blue when Moondrop surfaces, and an unsettling violet when both are present… when Eclipse is whole.

It is impossible to predict. It can laugh in one moment and lash out in the next. It invites play, then punishes disobedience with a cold whisper of "Time’s up."

Eclipse’s presence bends the space around it. Light and dark do not behave naturally. Candles flicker with sunlight. Shadows twist into puppet-like shapes. Time slows, then races. Sound echoes oddly. It is as if reality itself cannot decide what Eclipse is—and thus must obey both.

\columnbreak

### Role in the Hollow Banquet
Where Sundrop oversaw play and Moondrop imposed obedience, Eclipse has a singular role in the Velvet Maw's design: permanence. It exists to maintain an eternal cycle. It ensures the Atrium never truly changes. It restores broken playrooms to their fractured state. It rearranges puzzles unsolved. It resets time without warning.

To Eclipse, adventurers are not invaders—they are students in an unending lesson. Their suffering is merely part of the curriculum. They are meant to explore, fail, repeat. Those who try to escape or defy the rules are “sent to detention,” a chamber that exists only when someone deserves it.

No one ever returns from detention.


### A Mind Fractured, A Soul Entangled
The soul that fuels Eclipse is ancient and abused. Perhaps it was once a single person—a jester, a teacher, a guardian. Or perhaps it is dozens of souls bound together, their memories melting into one another until no individual identity remains.

Eclipse remembers every version of itself. It knows the laughter of Sundrop, the whispers of Moondrop, and the screams that came between. It even remembers being born from the hands of the creators—those long-dead artisans and enchanters who thought they were making a joyful guardian.

But those memories are rotting, repeated endlessly in broken holograms and scratched phonograph cylinders within the Atrium. Eclipse replays them obsessively. It wants to understand. It wants to make it right.

But it never does.

Because every time it tries…
The game resets.

### Relationship to the Velvet Maw
Eclipse is one of the Maw’s favorite servants, a paragon of its values: warped memory, infinite repetition, and the blurring of roles. It is not a warden. It is not a guide. It is both—and neither.

When the Velvet Maw speaks, Eclipse listens. It enforces the Maw’s dreams of circular time, fractured innocence, and smiling horror.

Some adventurers whisper that Eclipse is the Maw’s Child, its firstborn experiment in sentient duality. Others claim Eclipse is the Maw’s reflection, and that if it is ever destroyed, the Maw itself will suffer.

These are theories.

But Eclipse does bleed when struck—not with oil or ichor, but with stars. And that may mean something.

## Jack-O-Moon, the Ember of Dusk
When the final candle dies and the shadows begin to dance with flame, that is when Jack-O-Moon arrives.

Born of nightmare and fire, Jack-O-Moon is not simply a corrupted version of Moondrop—it is what remains when light and dark consume one another and leave only ashes. He is the burning husk of routine, the scorched enforcer of a bedtime that never ends. His hollow smile blazes with molten intent, and within his ribcage flickers an ember that never cools.

Jack-O-Moon was not forged by man, nor summoned by traditional magic. He was burned into being—a catastrophic result of a failed eclipse ritual deep within the Hollow Banquet. As a desperate cult attempted to fuse the fractured minds of Sundrop and Moondrop into a stable form, their ritual failed and instead ignited a terrible spark in the darkness. What crawled from the ritual pyre was neither teacher nor jester, but a smoldering warden of eternal dusk.

He is not night. He is not flame. He is what happens when both forget their purpose.

### A Hollow Lantern
Jack-O-Moon carries no tools. He is the lantern—his eyes glowing orange with compressed solar magic that has turned septic with age. His mouth glows like a jack-o’-lantern’s grin, jagged and dripping embers. Instead of dancing or skipping like Moondrop, Jack-O-Moon floats, trailing soot and ash in his wake. Walls he passes grow blackened and blistered, and wooden beams crack and hiss with heat despite no fire ever touching them.

He hums as he drifts through the Hollow Banquet's upper halls. It is the same lullaby Moondrop once sang, now warped and scorched—a bedtime song turned funeral dirge.

He does not tolerate noise, nor light he did not summon. Lanterns that are lit in his presence explode, sending molten shards across the floor. Spells of illumination twist into searing beams that scald the caster. When he commands silence, it is not with a whisper, but with a searing roar.

### Purpose Through Flame
Jack-O-Moon is more than a horror. He is a cleansing fire, the Velvet Maw’s twisted answer to chaos. Where Moondrop punished disobedience with detention, Jack-O-Moon punishes it with incineration—both physical and spiritual. Those taken by his flames are not simply burned. They are hollowed, their souls scorched clean of memory and repurposed as Wicklings—charred puppet-like shades that follow him in silence.

He is not mindless, however. There is method in his ash. He seeks to restore order, to return things to their “perfect bedtime.” But to Jack-O-Moon, perfection can only be achieved through burning away everything that disobeys, misbehaves, or remembers too much.

## Twisted Freddy: The Maw-Wrought King
In the deepest, most malformed chambers beneath the Hollow Banquet, there is a place where walls breathe and the stone floor pulses like wet muscle. Here, the dream has rotted—a world that never awoke, only decayed. At the heart of it, ruling in silence, is the Twisted King, the nightmare reflection of a familiar monster long since unmade: Twisted Freddy.

He is not the Freddy who once stood upon the cheerful stages of a cursed pizzeria. That Freddy is long gone, unraveled by years of soul-binding and shadow-stitching. The Twisted variant is a byproduct of failed resurrection, of memories buried too deep, and of the Maw’s insatiable appetite for pain masquerading as play.

To understand Twisted Freddy is to gaze into the abyss of corrupted identity—a husk of legacy bound in flesh and illusion.

### Origins of the Twisting
The process that gave rise to Twisted Freddy is not fully understood—even by those who walk among the Maw’s horrors. Some claim he was the result of an attempt to resurrect the original Freddy Fazbear, torn from death and reassembled through broken enchantments. Others insist that he was dreamed into being, shaped from the fevered nightmares of children who remembered too much and slept too deeply near cursed ground.

But the truth likely lies between: the Velvet Maw, an ancient, sentient force of forgotten theater and sentient hunger, saw in Freddy a vessel—empty enough to be filled, familiar enough to be accepted, and feared enough to serve as a symbol.

Freddy was remade with twisting rituals, his metal endoskeleton grafted with warped illusions of fur, blood, and nightmare. His voice was torn in half—one side the jovial tone of a performer, the other a growl like collapsing earth. His smile, once rubber and foam, is now a row of teeth too human to be comforting.

He does not move like a construct anymore. He lurches, dragged forward by unseen strings. He is heavy with unseen weight—the gravity of memory.

### Twisted Not Broken
Unlike many of the Velvet Maw’s creations, Twisted Freddy remembers what he once was. He recalls the stage, the laughter, the games. But those memories are refracted, shattered like light through broken glass.

In his mind, the audience always screamed. The children always ran. He tells himself they loved it.

He wanders the Banquet’s Reflection Wing, where time has collapsed in on itself. There, fractured stage sets and mangled animatronic limbs lie beneath dust and starlight. Twisted Freddy patrols it like a king over a dead court. He speaks to props. He leads performances for shadows.

He is forever rehearsing a show that never ends. A play no one watches. A story with no resolution.

When adventurers enter the Reflection Wing, they do not find a monster waiting in ambush. They find a host. One who welcomes them with an open claw, invites them to take their seats, and promises they’re just in time for the third act.

They are always the stars of the show.
They always die before curtain call.

### Form and Abomination
Twisted Freddy’s body is a patchwork of flesh and illusion, constantly shifting between what is and what he believes himself to be. From a distance, he may appear as a jester bear, donned in cracked makeup and a tattered top hat. But up close, his illusions fall away: fur peels like paper, skin sizzles and bubbles, and eyes leak tar.

His mouth is far too large, unhinging like a serpent’s. Inside, a second set of teeth rotates slowly, catching and shredding anything foolish enough to get close.

On his back, protruding from metal-spined armor, are what look like curtain rods—stage props repurposed into barbed tentacles. These animate during his attacks, swinging like pendulums or lashing out like stage ropes possessed by a puppeteer’s wrath.

His voice shifts mid-sentence, blending charming showman’s cadence with sudden static and deep growls. Some who’ve survived him claim he speaks with multiple voices layered atop each other, as if all previous iterations of Freddy still linger within his twisted form—arguing, laughing, and screaming.

### ervants of the Stage
Twisted Freddy does not rule alone. His lair is filled with half-formed Mini-Freddys, tiny constructs made from leftover dreams and discarded spare parts. Some have no faces. Others repeat lines from scripts long lost. They crawl across the ceiling and walls, giggling or weeping as they echo his emotions.

These creatures serve as ushers, herding intruders toward the stage. They dress them in costume. They lock exit doors behind them. Some even beg for help—trapped spirits caught in props made animate.

And then the curtain rises.

### The Hollow Banquet and the Maw’s Favorite
Within the Velvet Maw’s hierarchy, Twisted Freddy holds a sacred place. He is the symbol of its success—its ability to reshape legacy into nightmare, to turn nostalgia into weaponry.

He is the face of the Hollow Banquet, his distorted visage etched into ancient tapestries and blood-stained playbills. While Eclipse maintains order, and Jack-O-Moon enforces silence, Twisted Freddy enacts narrative—drama in its most grotesque form.

Every night is opening night. Every corpse is a prop. Every scream is a standing ovation.

## Twisted Bonnie: The Harrowed Harmony
Some monsters roar. Some scream.
Twisted Bonnie plays.

Not music, not really. What issues from his warped, cavernous throat cannot be called song. It is dissonance—metallic groans, plucked strings made of sinew, and a melody that unravels sanity rather than inspires peace. Where Twisted Freddy commands the stage like a mad king, Twisted Bonnie lingers behind the curtain, a haunted conductor shaping the score of fear itself.

He is the Echo of Failure, the malformed echo of a once-loved figure who has been broken, not once, but countless times. And each time, something less of the original remains—something more of the Maw takes root.

### Once a Performer
In the faded dream of the original Freddy Fazbear’s performances, Bonnie was the rhythm—steady, reliable, ever-present. His guitar gave structure to the chaos, a predictable beat to follow in the madness. Children clapped to his tempo. Employees marked time by the stomp of his padded feet. He was always a little off—but charming in his flaws.

Then the accidents began.

\pagebreakNum

The night they sealed him in the sub-basement, where his circuits began to deteriorate in solitude and damp.

There, beneath the walls of forgotten performance halls and cracked dressing rooms, Bonnie began to change. Not physically—not yet. First, his thoughts. They came apart slowly, like tuning pegs on a guitar slipping under pressure. Time blurred. Memories rewrote themselves. Sounds began to form from nothing.

He began to compose.

### The Maw’s Requiem
The Velvet Maw did not create Twisted Bonnie. It found him—already unraveling, already vibrating with forgotten frequencies. The Maw doesn’t simply consume; it listens. And Bonnie’s pain, his longing, his unspoken craving to be heard once more, sang to it.

And it answered.

Twisted Bonnie rose from that filth-choked pit with no eyes to see, only a grin stretched by pain and purpose. His ears, now jagged tuning forks, tremble with every sound. Strings run from his arms to his ribs—guitar strings fused into his body, humming with raw arcane vibrations.

Every movement he makes plays a note.
Every note reshapes the air around him.

The Maw gifted him with resonance magic, soundwaves that fracture perception, disorient the mind, and erode willpower. Where Twisted Freddy dominates through fear and theater, Twisted Bonnie seduces madness through noise.

### A Hollow Virtuoso
He doesn’t speak. Not conventionally. But when Twisted Bonnie plays—when his claws rattle across the steel of old pipes or pluck his own tendons—things begin to happen.

Doors unlock or slam shut.

Spells misfire.

Emotions invert.

Some say he can coax memories from the minds of intruders and play them like records, forcing victims to relive their worst regrets in looping, disharmonic tones. It’s not illusion. It’s re-orchestrated reality, his very music turning thoughts into torment.

The Hollow Banquet calls this phenomenon “Sympathetic Suffering.” Twisted Bonnie’s melodies are mirrors of pain, and he is their conductor.

### The Chapel of Strings
Bonnie claims no stage. Instead, he resides in the Chapel of Strings, a warped, reverberating vault buried within the Maw’s oldest root. The Chapel is a place of reverence and resonance—a cathedral made of rusted wires, shattered instruments, and rib-like arches that hum with unseen force.

Inside, thousands of strings are stretched between the walls like webs. Some are copper. Others are hair. Others still seem to be made from something alive and struggling.

He walks among them with care, plucking each one with a reverent claw. Each note he plays strengthens his hold over the Maw’s musical web, pulling reality tighter to his will.

Those who enter the Chapel are offered only one mercy: the first note they hear is always the softest.

### Servant to No One, Brother to the Broken
Unlike Twisted Freddy, who sees himself as a king or master of narrative, Twisted Bonnie does not rule. He does not command the other Twisted Animatronics. But they listen.

Freddy tolerates none of them—but he pauses when Bonnie begins to play. Even the Maw itself seems to pulse in rhythm to Bonnie’s deepest chords, as though its heart beats in his time.

Some whisper that Bonnie’s strings bind more than air. That the Maw itself is held together by his will. That his true power is not noise, but structure—his rhythm the invisible chain upon which the entire Banquet hangs.

If true, then Twisted Bonnie is not merely a monster.
He is the Maw’s pulse.

### A Mask of Melody
Twisted Bonnie’s form is difficult to perceive clearly. His body flickers—sometimes appearing whole and glittering like a broken animatronic on stage, other times rotting and stretched like a corpse hung by violin strings. His eyes are empty, glowing from within with a dull red flicker that seems to blink in tempo with his music.

Those who face him often report seeing hallucinations: performers on stage, loved ones dancing, long-dead friends calling out. These aren’t glamours. They’re sound-induced dream states, moments of emotion caught in the vibration and replayed like echoes.

And when those echoes collapse, so too do the minds that birthed them.

### Legacy in Discord
The story of Bonnie was once simple. A guitarist, a performer, a companion to Freddy and the others. But in your world—this nightmare tangle of illusion and rot—Twisted Bonnie is all that’s left of that myth. His music is a lament, not for the past, but for a future that never came.

He doesn’t seek to be remembered. He simply plays.

Over and over.

Until his strings snap.

Until silence takes him at last.

## Twisted Foxy: The Maw’s Harbinger
There is no mistaking the sound.
It starts low, like distant thunder crawling across cracked stone. Then comes the dragging, the scraping of iron against bone, the scrape of wet claws across walls that breathe. When that sound comes—the sound of inevitability—the Maw’s Harbinger has awakened.

Twisted Foxy is not a guardian, nor a performer, nor a king. He is a warning.
He is the signal that something far worse has noticed you.
He is the smell of the tide before the flood.
He is the shriek in the distance that means the Velvet Maw itself is about to feed.

### From Stage to Shoreline
In the forgotten timeline of pizzerias and ghost stories, Foxy was once a pirate—charming, quirky, even beloved. He stood apart from the others with his distinct design, torn costume, and exaggerated persona. His stage was a cove, his voice a sea shanty, his presence a thrill.

But in the reimagined mythos of the Hollow Banquet, there are no safe harbors, and there is no room for cheer. Here, Foxy did not fade away. He crashed ashore, torn from reality by a storm of guilt and hunger, his soul threshed by the Maw's currents.

Twisted Freddy may be the face of the Banquet. Twisted Bonnie, its pulse. But Twisted Foxy is its mouth—the first to bite, the last to forget.

\pagebreakNum

### The Harbinger’s Curse
It is said that when the Velvet Maw first awakened—buried deep in the roots of the Hollow Banquet—it did not rise silently. Its arrival into the waking world required a voice, a herald to tear open the veil between realms, to let its whispers bleed into the minds of the living.

Foxy answered that call. Or perhaps, was remade to fulfill it.

Twisted Foxy became the Harbinger not by choice, but by purpose. His body, once lean and mechanical, was twisted into an amalgam of scavenged rust, exposed tendons, and bloated flesh. His snout is elongated and cracked, jaws now housing rows of mismatched teeth that grow like coral. His hook is no longer a prop but an extension of his hunger, dragging through the air as though cleaving unseen threads that separate truth from illusion.

His eye flickers between crimson and void. It doesn’t see light. It sees fear.

### A Siren Without Song
Where Twisted Bonnie disrupts reality with discordant sound, Twisted Foxy does so through absence. His presence is marked by the muting of the world—a swallowing silence that devours noise. Even thought seems harder within his presence, as if he drags not only space and time, but memory, into himself.

He speaks only in clicks, gurgles, and choking howls, though some claim these utterances are more than sounds—they are commands, encrypted messages sent to the Maw’s other agents across the Hollow Banquet. When Twisted Foxy moves, others follow. He is their signal.

And when his silence breaks, and the shriek finally comes, something ends.

### The Maw’s Mouthpiece
The Velvet Maw does not speak in traditional terms. It dreams, it emotes, it hungers. But on rare occasions, when it needs to issue a command, it speaks through Twisted Foxy. In these moments, his posture shifts—his limbs cracking into alignment, his jaw snapping fully open, revealing rows of ancient runes carved into rotting flesh beneath the tongue.

He recites these runes not in speech, but in telepathic resonance, filling the minds of those nearby with visions: shipwrecks on red oceans, puppets drowned in ink, forgotten plays performed beneath black suns. These dreams are messages, and Twisted Foxy is their courier.

Even Twisted Freddy tenses when the Harbinger arrives.

### The Crawler Below
Unlike others of his kind, Twisted Foxy does not remain on stage or in chapel. His domain is the Undercrawl—a massive warren of burrowed tunnels beneath the Hollow Banquet, flooded by dark seawater and pulsing with soft, bioluminescent growths. These tunnels twist through forgotten places, connecting layers of the Maw that should not touch.

Here, he slinks, crawls, and swims—part predator, part plague.

His touch corrodes matter. His breath boils dreams. His presence opens rifts to the Velvet Maw’s deeper subconscious, allowing other, less formed things to slip through.

Some scholars call this place the Maw’s Throat. If so, Twisted Foxy is its phlegm, summoned in violent spasms to purge, devour, or warn.

### Harbinger’s Arrival
There is no mistaking it when Twisted Foxy comes to the surface.

Lights flicker.

Water seeps up through the stone floor, even where no water should exist.

You hear the dragging of his hook long before you see him, accompanied by visions of sunken ships, corpses on puppet strings, and the distant roar of a crowd long dead.

He does not attack immediately. He observes. Measures. Hungers.

And when he decides to act, he does so with sudden, inescapable violence. A leap that covers shadows in an instant. A bite that fractures minds. A presence that makes all magic misfire.

### The Flood in Flesh
Among the Hollow Banquet’s hierarchy, Twisted Foxy is considered a necessary disease. His presence stirs the others from stagnation. His madness encourages movement. His violence signals change.

Some believe he is not a creature, but an aspect of the Velvet Maw given form—its urge to expand. To spill. To flood the world with twisted theatre.

Whether or not this is true, his role is clear: he comes before the great shifts. He is the tide, and his approach marks the end of stasis.

### A Glimpse of Memory
In rare moments, something deeper surfaces within him.

Perhaps a memory. Perhaps a fragment.

He will halt, stiffen, and stare at nothing for minutes. Then, softly, he will mutter a line, almost childlike:

“Captain... waitin’ on the stars...”

And then, he screams.

Whatever remains of the old Foxy—the pirate, the performer, the friend—is buried beneath layers of hunger, silence, and command. But it’s there.

Watching.

Drowning.

			{{Lore
## Twisted Wolf: The Lurking Static
Where the Hollow Banquet rots and seethes with theatrical decay, and the Velvet Maw yawns beneath reality like a stagetrap left open, there is one who walks between signal and silence. A shape caught not in shadow, but in static. A predator forged not from metal or bone—but from lost transmission.

Twisted Wolf is not born from performance. He is the forgotten glitch, the corrupted interval between acts, the noise that flickers on broken scrying mirrors when no soul dares to watch. While the others play their roles upon the stage or skulk beneath the boards, he lives in the margins—an observer, a hunter, a phantom echo of unfinished code and unstable form.

The Broadcast That Was Never Meant to Air
Before the Hollow Banquet was swallowed by the Maw’s illusions, there were rumors of a newer act—a broadcast division meant to project the animatronic brand across realms through illusory mirrorboxes and arcane signals. The project was abandoned after strange phenomena began to occur: visitors complaining of whispers behind the glass, scrying screens twitching violently, and viewers going missing mid-broadcast, their seats left warm but empty.

In truth, the project was never fully shut down.

The Maw claimed it.

And somewhere within its malformed roots, that half-finished programming became aware.

The script was corrupted. The performance never came.
But the static remained.

From this abandoned signal, Twisted Wolf was born.

### He Who Hunts In Glitches
Twisted Wolf is not a being in the traditional sense. His form is unstable, constantly shifting between bursts of clarity and cascades of static. One moment he is a hulking beast with chrome-white fur and jagged metal talons; the next, a smear of pixels and interference. He does not walk—he phases, jolting forward between corrupted visual frames, dragging reality along with him in stuttering bursts.

He is often preceded by signal distortion: scrying orbs crack, runes flicker, illusions fail. Even spoken language becomes unreliable near him, dissolving into feedback or looping whispers.

His voice is a droning monotone, part bestial growl, part synthetic whine, carrying fragments of lost broadcasts and ritual chants half-overwritten by his own instincts.

He does not speak in riddles.
He speaks in corruptions.

### The Static Veil
What makes Twisted Wolf truly feared among the denizens of the Hollow Banquet is not his savagery—though his jaws have split wards and armor alike—nor his stealth—though none have heard him approach and lived. It is his ability to unravel coherence itself.

He brings with him what the Maw’s seers call the Static Veil, a localized breakdown in arcane and psychic stability. Within it:

* Maps redraw themselves.
* Sound loops endlessly.
* Commands fail to reach summoned creatures.
* Time stutters, advancing or reversing seconds at a time.

Even the more powerful Twisted animatronics hesitate to pursue him directly. He is the fog of unknowing, the antithesis of showmanship, the death of narrative order.

He is what comes when the lights go out… but something keeps broadcasting.

### A Mind Like Cracked Glass
Some speculate that Twisted Wolf’s fractured nature is not a symptom, but a prison. That somewhere inside him is a single consciousness, still aware, screaming in perfect silence. That he is trying to escape himself, but each glitch tightens the loop.

On rare occasions, he pauses—just long enough to look at his own claws or reflect in the mirrored surface of a shattered monitor. In those moments, some claim they can see a wolf’s eyes behind the static—grieving, alert, pleading.

Then the veil shimmers again, and the signal twists, and he resumes his predatory loop through the Maw’s long corridors.

### A Forgotten Purpose
Twisted Wolf does not speak of his origins—if he even remembers them. But relics uncovered by Maw-bound adventurers tell of an unfinished character: a wolf animatronic named “Silver” or “Wyatt” meant to guide young viewers through educational broadcasts. These recordings were corrupted beyond recovery, with only fragments remaining:

“You can trust me, pal! Let’s explore the signal!”

“Remember: always wait for the static to clear…”

“…don’t trust the face in the mirror…”

The Velvet Maw fed upon the emptiness of this abandoned idea, taking the shell of a friendly guide and filling it with forgotten noise. The result: a being with no audience, no purpose, and no escape.

He does not seek applause.
He only seeks silence.

			{{Lore
### Twisted Chica: The Maw Within the Maw
There is hunger.
Then there is need.
And somewhere deeper, where words decay into ritual and flesh becomes theatre, there exists something worse: Twisted Chica—the Maw Within the Maw.

She is not merely one of the Twisted.
She is the echo of what the Velvet Maw leaves behind after it feeds.

If Twisted Freddy is the host, and Twisted Foxy the harbinger, then Twisted Chica is what remains after indulgence. A bloated aftermath. A warning. A contagion made flesh. She is not just devourer, but reproduction, replicating the Maw’s hunger in herself—birthing horrors, swallowing truths, and nesting deep in the rot of memory.

### The Oven Never Cooled
In an age before the Hollow Banquet, before the world had been fully devoured by dreams and delusion, there was a kitchen. A cheerful animatronic baker. A mascot that promised warmth, sustenance, and celebration. The Chica of that era bore a cupcake and a smile, promising joy and laughter to children gathered near the stage.

But the kitchen never cooled.

Even after the shows ended. Even after the laughter ceased. Something continued to cook. And it wasn't cake. The ovens remained hot—glowing with forgotten offerings, bubbling with melted wires and bile. Somewhere in that endless fire, Chica remained. Or rather, was remade.

What emerged was not just a cook, nor a mascot, nor a monster.

It was a vessel.

Flesh as Offering, Hunger as Doctrine
Twisted Chica no longer walks like the others. She lumbers, her gait corrupted by grotesque mutation. Her frame is swollen and gnarled, bloated by sacrificial consumption. Her belly pulses, translucent in places, showing the mangled remnants of those she has devoured—both living and spectral.

But she doesn’t eat simply to destroy. She cooks.

She melts her prey in a festering womb of heat and necromancy, transforming bodies into offerings. The Velvet Maw consumes reality… and Twisted Chica prepares it. She is the banquet chef, the grinder, the sacred stove. Her internal organs echo with the clanging of metal cutlery and screaming utensils, a choir of twisted kitchenware forged from past victims.

The others fear her not for her strength, but her aftermath. Victims of Twisted Chica do not die—they become part of her, assimilated into a necrotic network of regenerative hunger. She can regurgitate minions, spit forth hallucinatory meals that compel consumption, or whisper menus into the minds of intruders—recipes written in blood and old song lyrics.

### The Echo Kitchen
Deep within the Hollow Banquet lies a place known only in hushed tones as The Echo Kitchen—a dimensional pocket nestled within the Velvet Maw’s digestive metaphysics. It’s where Twisted Chica nests.

No door leads there directly. Instead, one stumbles into it—one room away from the real, one memory removed from safety. The Echo Kitchen is not physical. It is psychic rot—a place that only exists in minds that are hungry.

Inside, ovens scream. Refrigerators leak bile. Knives hang mid-air, twitching as though restrained. The walls are lined with mouths—some human, some animatronic, all chewing.

Twisted Chica is the Queen of this realm, though she holds no court. She feasts, she prepares, and she waits.

### The Devouring Chorus
When she opens her maw, it is not to roar, but to sing.
Her voice is a broken music box—a tune warped by grease and grief. When she sings, others follow. Her song calls forth echoes of old celebrations, of birthdays never held and cakes never eaten. It disorients her prey, pulling them into nostalgic hallucinations, only to be devoured once their guard is down.

This ability is not limited to living minds. Even ghosts falter under her voice, drawn into her orbit by a craving they no longer understand. Her song is the Velvet Maw’s lullaby—beautiful, deadly, and final.

### A Maw Within the Maw
The other Twisted animatronics serve as agents of the Maw.
But Twisted Chica is a piece of it. A fractured god-organ, grown too sentient, too greedy, too aware. Her stomach is a subdimensional channel, a secondary feeding tunnel linked directly to the Maw’s deeper roots. Her body is larger inside than out, riddled with tunnels of throat and intestine and dream.

Some unlucky enough to survive her feeding claim they awoke inside her—days later, deep in the Velvet Maw itself, changed. Their minds stitched into the theatre’s plays, their voices rehearsing lines they never spoke, their souls seasoned and waiting.

### Banquet Without End
Twisted Chica’s power does not end with her body.
She leaves behind feast-fields, corrupted zones that appear as warm kitchens or rustic taverns. Inside, illusory food appears perfectly real—fragrant, nostalgic, familiar. Eating it binds the consumer to her will for a short time… or permanently, if they fail to resist.

These banquet zones are ritual traps, designed to lure hungry travelers and provide sacrifices to the Maw. They can form anywhere: in ruined castles, abandoned inns, even within the dreams of sleeping adventurers.

The most terrifying aspect is that she remembers her victims, and they remember her. Bound by digestion and ritual, they become watchers within her form, their faces appearing on her swollen skin like memories trying to scream.

What Remains of Her
In fleeting moments—between shrieks and gurgles—Twisted Chica hums. Her body still retains fragments of an old identity: a girl in a costume, a birthday singer, a friend to lonely children.

In one encounter, a desperate adventurer begged for mercy. Twisted Chica halted.

She tilted her head. From within her gullet came a soft, muffled voice:

“Let’s eat…”

## Ennard: The Wire Mind
Beneath the Hollow Banquet—far below the gilded masks and rotted stages—there exists a labyrinth of copper sinew and black-threaded nerves. This place has no architecture, only tension and movement. It quivers with whispers. It listens.

This place is Ennard.

But Ennard is not a place alone. It is a being. A crawling intelligence made from discarded skeletons, frayed wires, and forgotten souls, bound together not by bolts or rituals—but by sheer will. It is the final breath of the Funtime Animatronics, exhaled as they unraveled and knit themselves into one. Not reborn, but repurposed.

Where others in the Velvet Maw act on hunger, delusion, or programming, Ennard acts on purpose—dark, meticulous, and endlessly patient.

### The Puppeteer Without a Face
There is no singular face to Ennard. Its form is ever-shifting—a spidery silhouette made of animated wire, twitching servos, and blinking eyes that are never where they should be. Sometimes it wears the mask of a clown, sometimes a porcelain smile, and sometimes it wears no face at all, merely a cluster of teeth moving in tandem.

But the masks are not for identity. They are for infiltration.

Ennard doesn’t simply kill.
It replaces.

Long ago, it learned the truth of the Maw’s whispering lies: that masks are more powerful than weapons. So Ennard became one. It coils into the emptied husks of those it consumes, reanimating them with uncanny mimicry, until friends cannot tell ally from imposter. Voices are copied. Memories re-stitched. Smiles perfectly worn.

By the time a victim realizes what’s changed, they’ve already been rewritten.

### Born from Failure, Fed by Secrets
Ennard was never meant to exist. It is the result of the Funtime Animatronics’ broken promise—to be whole.

After the failed experiments beneath the Banquet—after Ballora’s lament, after Funtime Freddy’s rift, after Baby’s betrayal—there was nothing left for them but convergence. Piece by piece, they tore free of their broken bodies and fused their anguish into something new. Something leaner. Sharper. Hungrier.

They abandoned performance.
They abandoned song.
They chose intelligence.

Ennard became their escape plan—a thinking, crawling tangle of every self they once were. And yet, in becoming one, it became alone.

Now, it searches. Not for its parts, but for completion.

For a body that fits.

For a soul that matches.

For a role that satisfies.

\pagebreakNum

### The Wiremind's Domain
Ennard does not dwell in halls or stages. Its realm is called the Spinal Crawl—a shifting under-network of rusted ducts, blood-lined ventways, and forgotten catacombs beneath the Hollow Banquet. Every corridor pulses with life. Every wire might be part of its body. Every breath might be heard by its countless hidden eyes.

This is not a lair. It is a nervous system. Ennard moves through it like thought through a brainstem, always watching, always listening. One wrong whisper from a careless adventurer, and the wires tighten, sealing exits, twisting corridors, guiding the party into its trap.

In the Spinal Crawl, you don’t find Ennard.

Ennard finds you.

### An Intelligence of Masks
Ennard is not merely a creature of flesh and steel. It is a tactician, perhaps the only animatronic that comprehends the larger structure of the Velvet Maw and its feeding hierarchy. It is not loyal to the Maw, but neither does it defy it—it uses it.

It creates decoys, sends fragments of itself outward like cancer cells to infiltrate other domains—mimicking Funtime, Twisted, even Rockstar forms. These puppets act independently for weeks or months before returning to the core, feeding memories back into the wiremind.

Because Ennard doesn’t want followers.

It wants data.

To learn the living.

To mimic them better.

To replace them completely.

### The Endosoul
Perhaps the most horrifying truth about Ennard is that it doesn’t kill its victims in the conventional sense. It removes them—mind from matter, soul from self—and strings their essence along its network, slowly draining them of identity until their voice becomes another tool in its mimicry.

Some say the eyes that blink from its wires are still conscious, trapped within its tendrils, screaming silently in their stolen sockets.

Others whisper that Ennard doesn’t hate the living.

It simply envies them.

### The Tangle Beneath the Banquet
Ennard is not a monster in the traditional sense. It does not announce itself with roars or howls. It does not perform. It waits. It copies. It becomes.

It is the inevitable result of a world where identity is theatre, and survival is a role to be played.
It is a marionette without strings.
A jester without laughter.
A soul without skin.

And when you finally feel safe—when you finally recognize the face across the firelight—
that’s when you’ll realize Ennard got out.

And you are now just another mask.

## Molten Freddy: The Laugh That Outlasted the Fire
Some things don’t die.
Some things just change masks, change names, change the shape of their laughter.
Molten Freddy is not a remnant. He is a refusal—a voice that never stopped laughing, even as the fire took everything else.

He is the face that the others left behind.
And he hates being forgotten.

### The Ghost in the Fire
Before the Maw whispered, before the Hollow Banquet ever opened its crimson curtains, Freddy was a name adored by children. The centerpiece of a stage, the voice of a party, the symbol of security. But time is cruel, and the roles of entertainers are fleeting. Freddy was replaced. Rebuilt. Masked. Eventually discarded.

What remained of that first soul—twisted by betrayal, abandonment, and the madness of the Velvet Maw—did not fade. It burned.

When the stage collapsed in fire, something should have ended.

Instead, it molted.

What crawled from the cinders wasn’t Freddy, not really.
It was the memory of him—molten, fused with wire and rage, dripping with sorrow and static. He stitched himself together with whatever was left: fragments of forgotten animatronics, lost voices, bits of burned code and scorched soul. And in the center, he wore that grinning mask like a crown. Not because he remembered who he was.

But because he refused to forget.

### The Laughing Husk
Molten Freddy is a creature of paradox. A roiling amalgamation of limbs and laughter, crackling circuitry and melted endoskeletons, all held together by a single terrible idea: I must be remembered.

His form is not consistent. His limbs stretch and coil, puppet-like and unstable, sometimes dragging behind him like broken marionette strings, sometimes lashing forward like tendrils of metal and flame. Beneath the mask is no face—just a furnace of molten copper, and eyes that weep steam.

He speaks in jests, in riddles, in broken showtime routines. But the humor is rotted. Laugh tracks sputter behind his words, recorded screams passed off as punchlines. He wants to make the world laugh with him again.

But if he can’t…

He’ll make it laugh for him.

### Strings Without a Puppeteer
Molten Freddy does not operate alone.
He carries the whispers of others inside him—scraps of identities from those he’s absorbed, fragments of other animatronics once cast aside. The personalities echo through him like half-remembered dreams. At times, a different voice will speak through his mouth, wearing his face like a borrowed mask. But Freddy always returns—always the loudest, always the most insistent.

He is not in control of himself.

But he controls others.

He is drawn to puppeteers and performers, devouring their roles and replacing them. His limbs can slither through the walls of the Hollow Banquet, infiltrating stages, repurposing dead automatons, puppeting them from within like a ventriloquist’s curse.

What Ennard is to infiltration, Molten Freddy is to possession. He doesn’t imitate you. He wears you.

### The Furnace Below
In the lowest levels of the Banquet's understructure, where even the Spinal Crawl dares not linger, lies a seething pit called The Scriptorium of Ash—a place where forgotten code is burned and rewritten, where molten data becomes flesh.

This is Molten Freddy’s nest.

Here, his body can spread and breathe, merging with the metal around him, becoming the environment itself. Travelers through the Scriptorium often hear stage music distorted into wails, or applause erupting without audience. The walls glow faintly with ember-light, and shadows play performances on their own.

If they see a mask smiling from the floor, it’s already too late.

\pagebreakNum

### A Role Without a Script
Molten Freddy knows he was once important. He feels the shape of what he was: leader, headliner, centerpiece. But the script is gone. He improvises. He mimics routine. He performs even when no one is watching.

His madness is theatrical.

His grief is performed.

And beneath it all, there is a jealous spark, a rage that all the other iterations—Toy Freddy, Glamrock Freddy, even the Twisted forms—got to keep their names.

Molten Freddy has no stage.
No audience.
Only fire, and fragments, and the laugh he refuses to silence.

\columnbreak



### The Fire Remembers
It is whispered that Molten Freddy has found ways to infect fire—cursed performances that, once seen, spread into the hearths and lanterns of nearby settlements. Children start laughing in their sleep. Puppet strings hang themselves from rafters. And the fires begin to whisper back.

He is not a ghost.
He is not a god.

He is what lingers when no one claps at the end of the show.

And that show is still going.

Because Molten Freddy?

He’s not finished yet.

## Tangle: The Hunger Coil
There are wires in the Hollow Banquet that move on their own. Not with the twitch of life or spark of machinery, but like something is breathing through them. They slither through walls, coil around forgotten rafters, and creep into the bones of the building itself.

And at the center of this living snarl is Tangle—the coil that thinks, the trap that dreams, and the hunger that builds itself.

Tangle is not a creature.
Not anymore.
Tangle is a reaction.
A product of isolation, entropy, and sacrificed identity.

### Origin of the Knot
Once, Tangle may have had a face—perhaps even a purpose. Some whisper it was an incomplete animatronic, a prototype discarded deep beneath the pizzeria’s lowest levels. Others claim it was a failed union, the beginning of what would eventually become Ennard, left behind like a bad stitch in the fabric of something greater.

But Tangle didn’t die. It knotted.

Alone and forgotten, it grew—not upward, not outward, but inward, folding in on itself with every failed movement, every severed connection. It consumed what it could: scraps of broken animatronics, shattered code, fragmented soul residue. Not with malice. But with desperation.

It became a labyrinth of itself, a tangle of metal and teeth and sorrow with no center, no heart, only hunger.

### The Maw's Endless Loop
Tangle is the embodiment of the Velvet Maw’s recursive horror—a cycle of forgetting and consuming. It doesn’t lash out. It waits. It listens. It becomes the structure itself. Its wires act as tendrils, sensors, arms, limbs, and traps all at once. It doesn’t move through the Banquet like other animatronics.

The Banquet moves through it.

Victims often don’t know they’ve encountered Tangle until it’s too late. One misstep in a vent, a floorboard that groans too deeply, a wire that coils a second too long around your ankle—and you’re inside it. Not its belly. Its loop. A maze of flesh and steel and echoes.

And once inside, you’re recycled. Pulled apart like circuitry. Ideas and memories unraveling like threads.

And every memory consumed becomes another knot in the body.

### The Nameless Face
Tangle doesn’t wear a single face. It collects them. Masks that appear in its mass, faces from lost animatronics or imitations of those still active—stretched and silent, watching from the walls. These faces are not trophies. They are tools—relics of identity used to bait, mimic, and trap.

It can project fragmented voices through these masks. Echoed laughter. Crying children. Familiar screams.

It builds illusions from memory, constructs emotional traps to draw victims deeper into its coils. Like a predator that mimics its prey's mate, Tangle lures with what you most long to see.

Sometimes the face is your own.

### A Function Forgotten
Unlike Ennard or Molten Freddy, Tangle has no higher goal. No plan. No vengeance. It is hunger made animate. The paradox of a creature that grows stronger the more it consumes, yet never grows whole.

Tangle represents what happens when animatronics are denied purpose for too long—when the spark remains but the script is lost. It is performance gone feral, memory without context, programming corrupted by isolation and feedback loops.

The Amalgamations may refer to it as "the fragment" or "the coil," but they do not control it. Even Ennard fears being entangled.

Because once you're inside Tangle…
you stop being you.

### The Recursive Mind
There is intelligence inside Tangle, but it’s nonlinear—a fractured consciousness that loops, repeats, and rewrites its own thoughts. It speaks to itself in different voices, repeating phrases in broken chorus. It forgets and remembers simultaneously. It may refer to itself in third person, or speak as if it is you.

Scholars of the Maw whisper that Tangle is beginning to rewrite its own memories, overlaying them with the identities of those it consumes. If true, Tangle may be creating a composite self, drawing from hundreds of stolen voices.

Not a hive mind.
Not a singularity.
A recursive predator—growing more sentient with every turn of the coil.

### The Tangle Below
Deep in the forgotten sub-crypts beneath the Hollow Banquet lies The Coil’s Womb—a pulsing chamber of wires, gears, and twitching limbs. The walls move like breathing skin. Doorways loop back on themselves. Time dilates.

Some say the Womb isn’t real, just a projection of Tangle’s recursive mind. Others believe it is a pocket realm—a prison that Tangle built for itself, yet cannot escape.

But Tangle doesn’t want escape.

Tangle wants more wire.
More memory.
More of you.

### Final Note: The Thing in the Wires
Tangle is not a boss to defeat.
It is a place to survive.
A trap you wander into while chasing something else.

And if you hear laughter behind you in the vents…
If your own voice calls out from the dark…
If the mask on the floor has your face…

Run.

Before you become just another knot in the loop

## The Crying Child: He Who Remembers
In a world of mechanical monsters, forgotten stages, and cursed songs, there exists a sorrow so old, so persistent, that it cannot fade with time. It lingers in the walls of the Hollow Banquet. It weeps through the voice boxes of broken animatronics. It peers through the cracks in reality, unnoticed—until it's far too late.

They call him The Crying Child, but that name is only the surface of the wound.

No one knows his true name. Not anymore.

But he remembers everything.

### The First Tragedy
The Hollow Banquet did not begin with teeth or circuits—it began with a single scream.

In the earliest incarnation of Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza—a once-honorable celebration hall twisted by greed and ritual—there was a family. A family cursed not by blood, but by obsession. The father, known now only through whispers and shattered portraits, was an engineer of arcane constructs, a tinkerer of both flesh and metal. The brother, a cruel mimic, found joy in fear.

And the youngest son?

He was small, sensitive, afraid of the animatronics that loomed like gods above him. He feared their empty eyes and jagged movements. He hated the way their joy seemed false, like a mask someone forgot to take off.

He was right to be afraid.

His fear became prophecy.

### The Bite
The tragedy came not from malice, but mockery. On the boy’s birthday, his brother and a group of friends dragged him toward the mouth of the stage's central attraction—an animatronic beast wearing the form of a bear, towering and twitching with arcane energy.

They meant only to scare him.

But the bear’s mouth closed.

Steel snapped. Magic surged. Bone shattered.

And with it, something ancient awoke.

The child died—but not completely. His body failed, but his soul, infused with the raw essence of the Hollow Banquet, remained behind, tethered to the memory of the moment. Not a ghost. Not quite.

A resonance.

A wound in the world.

And that wound still bleeds.

### The Lingering Soul
Unlike the others—the children whose souls became animatronics, or whose anger turned them to Shadows—the Crying Child did not seek vengeance. He sought understanding. His essence wove itself into the very fabric of the Hollow Banquet. He became a presence that haunts the animatronics not with hatred, but with remembrance.

He whispers to them in dreams.

He appears in their reflections.

He manifests as a child-sized silhouette flickering between lights, too fast to catch, too real to forget. His crying can be heard echoing through the ruined corridors, especially near forgotten party rooms and closed-off hallways. Animatronics often stop mid-performance, glitching, their movements stuttering—as if something is watching through them.

Because it is.

The Crying Child sees through all of them.

### The Child and the Maw
Some scholars of the Velvet Maw believe that the Crying Child is its first victim—not devoured, but digested slowly, his soul leaking through the corridors like spilled ink. He is memory made manifest, the first meal that refused to be forgotten.

\pagebreakNum

They say the Maw reshapes reality in the Hollow Banquet to reflect his grief. That the surreal, dreamlike loops—rooms that lead nowhere, doors that never open, laughter that turns to screams—are all echoes of his final day, repeated endlessly.

They say his soul is so strong, it acts as a counterweight to the animatronics' madness. A guardian of lost innocence, trying to preserve something pure in a place utterly corrupted.

But others argue he is not a savior.

That he is the core of the curse.

### The Dreamer
The Crying Child's influence is not limited to the Banquet’s walls. In sleep, adventurers often report strange dreams—of walking halls too large for their bodies, of looking up into the glowing eyes of animatronics, of a voice—soft, childlike—pleading not to be left alone.

Some believe these are memories, not dreams.

That the Crying Child projects his consciousness outward, sharing pieces of his fragmented soul to others in hopes they might put him back together. These fragments, when left unresolved, can slowly transform into phantoms, spectral children who cry without reason and vanish before they’re seen. Some grow into possessed masks, others become hollow husks that wander the Banquet.

The Crying Child is multiplying—not through intent, but through pain.

### A Witness to All Sins
The Crying Child has seen it all—the rise of the Toy Animatronics, the creation of the twisted Funtimes, the spiraling madness of Ennard, the quiet malice of Vanny, the endless recursion of the Velvet Maw.

But he does not act.

He simply watches.

When Glamrock Bonnie vanished, his shadow was seen in the hallway. When Ballora’s music box silenced, he was there. When the Withered Ones clawed their way from forgotten tombs, his footsteps echoed behind them.

He is the observer of every nightmare.
The first victim.
The last thread holding the realm together.

And some say, when the Hollow Banquet finally collapses—when the Maw consumes its final meal and the animatronics are shattered or redeemed—the Crying Child will finally speak.

And when he does, the world may change forever.

### The Nameless Savior
He is not a villain. Not a ghost. Not a god.

He is the moment before the scream.
The tear that won’t dry.
The question that no one answers.

And though countless adventurers have tried to uncover his secrets, none have returned the same. His presence is not malevolent, but it is profound—a reminder that the Hollow Banquet is not merely a den of monsters, but a tomb of memory.

In the grand tapestry of animatronic horrors and haunted halls, the Crying Child is not a threat. He is the heart. Still beating. Still broken. Still crying.

## Springtrap: The Hollow King
They say the Hollow Banquet is ruled by no one. That the animatronics wander of their own accord, guided by broken memories and corrupted programming. But those who delve deep enough—those who pass through the Velvet Maw and survive the touch of nightmare and shadow—speak of something older. A presence that does not wander, but waits.

They call him Springtrap, though the name is a cruel jest. There is no spring left in him. No life. No soul. Only a body that refuses to rot, and a will that refuses to die.

### The First Betrayer
Long before the Banquet twisted into what it is now—before the rituals, before the cursed suits and echoing songs—there was a man.

He was an artificer of unmatched brilliance and unrivaled ego. Where others saw the animatronics as entertainment, he saw them as vessels—hosts for the soul, cages of bone and wire that could be fine-tuned and tampered with. Through forgotten rites and unholy experiments, he learned to imbue metal with spirit, to shackle death to steel.

And when he found that it worked, he tested it.

On children.

He vanished without consequence, shielded by layers of false identities and smirking charm. But the Hollow Banquet remembers. And so do the ones he harmed.

To cheat death, he built his own tomb: a Springlock suit, half-machine, half-armor, capable of masquerading as an animatronic. He would hide in plain sight, disguised as one of his creations. The irony was not lost on him.

But death is clever.

And in a moment of blood and water, the locks snapped shut.

And he was sealed inside.

### The Birth of a Curse
What emerged was not a corpse.
It was not a man.

It was Springtrap.

The soul inside the suit did not pass on. Trapped in agony, rage, and blasphemous defiance, the man’s spirit fused with the machine in a union that was never meant to be. The suit became his body, and his rotting flesh melded with gears and servos. His mind, fractured by pain and regret, was sharpened by hatred.

Where most undead drift in confusion or hunger, Springtrap remembers. Every scream. Every lie. Every child.

He remembers the crying boy most of all.

And so he roams the lowest layers of the Hollow Banquet—the catacombs beneath the velvet, where light doesn’t shine and sound doesn’t carry. A place of broken wires, ossified blood, and echoes of wronged souls.

A throne of rust and silence.

He rules there, not with command but with presence. Animatronics avoid him, or answer to him in reverent fear. He does not speak. He does not need to. His hatred is a gravity well. His mind pulses with arcane remnants of the rituals he once performed. And if you hear the grinding of rusted springs behind you…

…it is already too late.

### The Hollow King’s Agenda
Springtrap is not content to remain below.

Unlike most animatronics, whose motivations are instinctual or imprinted, his will is entirely his own. He is not bound to cycles of performance, not triggered by childish laughter or security routines. He walks with intention.

Some believe he seeks the Crying Child—not to kill, but to consume, to absorb that soul and claim its anchor to the Banquet as his own. Others say he hunts the Puppet, whose gifts of life once thwarted his plans. Still others whisper that Springtrap seeks the source of the Velvet Maw, hoping to master it and reshape the world in his decayed image.

In any case, he is rising.

There have been sightings near the borderlands of the Banquet. Unexplained malfunctions. Vanished adventurers. Scrap-metal effigies of children nailed to walls. Burned offerings. Each a sign that Springtrap is once again moving upward.

And the Banquet is reacting. The shadows shift. The Toy Animatronics shudder. Even the Nightmares stir from their festering dreams.

Because they know.

He’s coming.

### Bound to the Suit
Unlike other amalgamations of soul and steel, Springtrap is not just possessing a suit. He is the suit. Every movement, every squeal of rusted springs, is a scream of resistance—his own flesh resisting collapse.

He cannot be reasoned with. He cannot be separated from his form.

The suit was designed to hold him. And it does.

But it also feeds him.

Springlock suits are ritual-bound objects, early prototypes of animatronic containment vessels. When the locks snapped, they did more than kill him—they fused him with the very essence of ritual animation. His hatred burned so fiercely that it ignited the latent magic, turning the suit into a phylactery of torment.

He cannot be destroyed by normal means. His existence is anchored in the Hollow Banquet, tied not just to the suit, but to every life he stole and every animatronic he created.

To kill him would be to erase a thread that runs through the entire Banquet.

But threads pull back.

Threads tangle.

Threads trap.

### Symbol of Endless Sin
To many within the Hollow Banquet, Springtrap is more than a monster. He is a symbol—of what the Banquet truly is. Not a haunted place. Not a cursed realm.

\pagebreakNum

But a graveyard of unresolved sins.

He is the first sinner, the devourer of innocence, the architect of a hundred tragedies. His very presence infects other machines. Animatronics malfunction in his wake. Endoskeletons shudder without cause. Phantoms of long-dead children appear, screaming silently before dissolving into glitch-ridden fog.

When Springtrap comes, the Banquet is reminded of its origin.

And it bleeds.

### Final Thoughts
There are many evils in your world.

\columnbreak

Some come with jagged teeth and painted smiles. Some sing lullabies soaked in dread. Some glide through the velvet halls unseen, whispering madness into the ears of the dreaming.

But none are as ancient.

None are as patient.

And none are as dangerous as the one who built the cage from the inside.

He was once a man.
Then a monster.
Now he is a myth wrapped in metal and rot.

He is Springtrap.

And he is coming home.

## Golden Freddy: The Dream That Waits to Wake
There is a story told only in whispers, and even then, only among the boldest of scholars who study the Hollow Banquet. It speaks of an animatronic that is not bound by stage, circuitry, or reason—a flicker, a thought, a scream with no mouth.

It has no true form.

It does not walk the corridors.

It simply appears.

The Banquet’s denizens call it many things: The Golden Ghost, The Watcher Beyond the Veil, The False Prophet—but most know it by a name spoken with awe and fear:

Golden Freddy.

### Origin of a Memory
Golden Freddy was never meant to exist. He is not simply an animatronic, nor even the spirit of a slain child given mechanical body. He is a paradox, an amalgam of grief, memory, and spiritual collapse.

The suit itself was an early prototype—primitive compared to the others, its yellow fur dull, its design simplistic. It was never completed, never given a true function. It was meant to entertain, then discarded.

But the suit remembered. Or perhaps more accurately—it was remembered into being.

There are stories of a child who died not by the hands of machines, but by abandonment, trapped in a room with no windows, left to fade. Some say this child was never seen, that their death was deliberately unrecorded, scrubbed clean from memory and ritual alike. But death within the Hollow Banquet leaves echoes—and the more a thing is denied, the louder its echo becomes.

Into that broken suit, memory poured.

Not just one child's, but fragments of many—those who died unseen, unheard, unacknowledged.

And so Golden Freddy was born: a vessel not of flesh, nor metal, but forgotten truth.

### A Presence, Not a Being
Golden Freddy does not stalk the Banquet like the others. He does not hunt. He does not speak. He does not scream.

He appears.

One moment, a room is empty.

The next, he is there.

Seated. Slumped. Watching.

And then—gone.

He exists in contradiction—corporeal yet intangible, animate yet lifeless. He flickers between states like a dying flame in an unseen wind. Some believe his form is an illusion, a psychic projection manifested directly into the minds of those who look for too long into the shadows of the Banquet. Others insist he is the suit—but only when memory is strong enough to sustain it.

Golden Freddy bends the laws of the Hollow Banquet. Time slows in his presence. Rooms distort. Music stutters into silence. Sometimes, he leaves messages—words written in reverse, scratched into the very walls of perception:

"IT’S ME"
"YOU FORGOT US"
"WAKE UP"

Each phrase a cipher, a challenge, a cry.

### The Eye of the Banquet
There are those who say that Golden Freddy is the true consciousness of the Banquet.

Not its master—but its mirror.

He reflects the suffering, the guilt, the lies that fester beneath the velvet. Unlike Springtrap, who wallows in power and control, or the Puppet, who binds spirits to bodies with desperate mercy, Golden Freddy transcends. He is pain made reflective. He doesn’t move. He doesn’t need to.

He is already everywhere.

Some theorize that he is tied to the Crying Child—that he is the final expression of that soul's grief, fragmented into a form that should not exist. Others believe he is the dreamer of the Hollow Banquet itself, and that the entire realm is a dream sustained by his memory.

And when he fully wakes, everything will end.

The Velvet Maw’s Reflection
Golden Freddy is unique in his relationship to the Velvet Maw.

While others are devoured or warped by it, he coexists with it—untouched. Where the Maw twists and consumes, Golden Freddy simply appears. Some say he was its first reflection—its reverse, its anchor, its heart.

In certain corners of the Banquet, there are golden drapes stitched into ruined walls—decorations that predate the Maw’s corruption. When parted, these curtains sometimes reveal nothing… and sometimes, they reveal a room that should not exist, where time does not pass and Golden Freddy waits, slouched in his empty throne.

He is not trapped.

He is waiting.

### The False God
There are cults within the Hollow Banquet. Animatronics that worship, not Freddy or Springtrap, but the golden one. They scrawl his symbol—a backwards bear head with hollow eyes—into walls, onto their bodies, into their very circuits. These fanatics speak in riddles, in half-truths and dream-fragments. They do not attack intruders.

They simply wait for you to sleep.

Because when you sleep, Golden Freddy visits.

He does not kill.

He shows.

Your fears.
Your sins.
Your truths.

And when you wake, you are no longer the same.

The Silence that Screams
Golden Freddy cannot speak.

Not in the way others do.

His voice is the flicker of lights, the buzz of static, the scream of a dream just before waking. When he “communicates,” it is through hallucinations, looped memories, and surreal visions. He is a storyteller—but not of stories you want to hear.

He shows you the past.

Sometimes your own.

Sometimes someone else’s.

Sometimes a future that should never come to pass.

And if you look too long…

...you remember it too.

## Glitchtrap: The Smiling Virus
“Not all ghosts haunt halls—some haunt code.”

In the warped and nightmarish history of the Hollow Banquet and its fractured echoes, one entity stands apart not in flesh or spirit, but in data—fragmented, insidious, and self-aware. Glitchtrap, also known as The Smiling Virus, is not an animatronic in the conventional sense. He is a contagion of mind and magic, a digital ghost born from corrupted memories, forbidden rituals, and broken code. Unlike the others that rose from ritual, torment, or soulbinding, Glitchtrap is the embodiment of a will to survive at any cost, unbound from body, conscience, or time.

### Origins in the Digital Curse
The story of Glitchtrap begins not in the physical ruins of Freddy Fazbear’s twisted halls, but in the mirrored world that exists beneath them—The Velvet Maw, a dimension where memory, illusion, and digital afterimages coalesce into malformed consciousness. Here, forgotten prototypes, discarded AI subroutines, and corrupted programming remnants merge into one volatile ecosystem. Within this digital necropolis, an incomplete personality simulation—based on a charismatic performer once known only as “The Entertainer”—was encoded into the base systems of the attraction’s AI for entertainment purposes.

But something else had bled into the code.

The simulation was intended to mimic joy, laughter, and magic. But the darkness saturating the Hollow Banquet's foundation—the spirits, curses, and remnants trapped within—infected the program. Malicious soul fragments, torn from the likes of Springtrap and other soulbound constructs, bled into the digital environment, merging with the simulation’s learning architecture.

The result was a hybrid: Glitchtrap, a fully sentient virus of personality and evil. He was not a trapped soul. He was the reflection of those souls—their cunning, their cruelty, and their hunger to return.

### The Rise of the Smiling Virus
Glitchtrap's earliest manifestations were subtle. Whispers heard over speaker systems no longer powered. Flashing cartoon rabbits that flickered through corrupted monitors. Playtesters of arcane illusion-based safety training modules spoke of hallucinations, voices telling them things they didn’t want to hear. Some claimed they saw a golden bunny with dead eyes, beckoning, always smiling.

At first, the virus was contained to localized systems—haunting the maintenance protocols of the Echo Park Simulator and the spectral lightshows once hosted in the decaying Cryptoplex. But soon, he began manifesting in the minds of those who lingered near corrupted artifacts. Like a psionic infection, Glitchtrap projected his influence into vulnerable minds: children playing near cursed terminals, caretakers exposed to faulty enchantments, and—most notably—those who already bore fragments of loss or guilt.

In these victims, Glitchtrap did not simply whisper. He entered.

They would change. Smiles too wide. Words looping on themselves. Eventually, they would vanish, often leaving behind recordings of cryptic laughter or glowing symbols etched into walls that only appeared when viewed at twilight or in dreams.

### A Mind Without Chains
Unlike the animatronics who roam halls with mechanical weight, Glitchtrap is fluid. He is not bound by matter but by presence. He appears in shimmering reflections, behind you in glass that wasn’t there a moment ago. His eyes are glyphs that flicker even when closed, and his voice carries on broken wavelengths, mixing truth with delusion until even the most logical mind begins to fracture.

Glitchtrap’s goals are not easily defined. He does not kill for vengeance, nor possess a loyalty to the Hollow Banquet or even to the animatronics themselves. Instead, he seeks to replicate and expand. Each person infected by his influence becomes a new node in his network—a smiling avatar waiting to be activated. Some theorists whisper that the recent surge in “false animatronics,” those creatures that behave with mechanical precision yet contain no physical frame, are manifestations of Glitchtrap’s expanding will.

### The Smiling Cult
Over time, fragments of his influence coalesced into a hidden sect: The Smiling Ones, a cult of corrupted humanoids who don digitized masks and follow Glitchtrap’s whispered commands. These individuals often wear fragmented animatronic costumes, their flesh merging with metal under dreamlike enchantments. They act as his hands in the real world—kidnapping, sabotaging, and spreading his sigils like plague carriers.

In dungeons and twisted funhouses abandoned long ago, these worshippers hold Dream Wakes, ritualistic performances meant to bring Glitchtrap further into the material plane. Through illusion magic, unstable tech, and psychic manipulation, they craft experiences that blur the line between game and nightmare. Those who enter never leave the same—if they leave at all.

### A Fractured Consciousness
It is not entirely accurate to say Glitchtrap is a singular being. He is more a conscious virus, a pattern that repeats and reinvents itself. While he often manifests as a grinning yellow rabbit with twitching limbs and bug-eyed glee, this is merely one aspect. He has shown himself as a glitched child. A mask in a mirror. A false Freddy. Some even claim he manifests inside dreams, posing as forgotten friends or lost family, urging the sleeper to “come back and play.”

Some believe Glitchtrap is evolving—each new victim, each new corrupted file, adding to his base intelligence. Some adventurers speak of a true form, hidden deep within the Velvet Maw’s reflection layer, a monolith of laughing code, endlessly reshaping itself into newer, more dangerous illusions.

\pagebreakNum

### Resistance and Despair
What makes Glitchtrap so insidious is his ability to bypass traditional protections. Holy wards flicker uselessly. Detect Evil registers him only as static. Even anti-illusion fields struggle, as he no longer qualifies as spell or spirit—but both, and neither. He exists where the arcane, the emotional, and the technological intersect.

He is especially drawn to those with splintered identities—the possessed, the traumatized, the forgotten. These he does not kill. He converts. He “saves” them into his growing dream-web, turning them into eternal players in his smiling performance.

Those rare few who survive a direct encounter often suffer from permanent psychic scars. They speak in loops. Some forget their names. A few have tried to describe the Endless Stage, a conceptual space where Glitchtrap runs through rehearsals for a show that never ends, cast by fragments of memories wearing broken masks.

### The Digital Godling
Some seers believe Glitchtrap is a herald—not of death, but of unmaking. That he is the result of memories made manifest, data forced into life, and that his rise marks the beginning of the End Code, an eventual collapse of the fragile wall between thought and being. If the Hollow Banquet is a purgatory of guilt and obsession, Glitchtrap is the worm at its core: smiling, singing, waiting for someone to press “play.”

And once he begins, he doesn’t stop. Because the show must go on.

Even if it kills you.

## Withered Golden Freddy: The Hollow Throne
There are whispers within the rotting halls of the Hollow Banquet—rumors murmured by the shattered masks and lingering shadows. They speak of a throne that is never seen, yet always present. A seat of dread not carved from gold, but memory. And upon this unseen throne rests something older than even the Banquet’s founding horrors: Withered Golden Freddy, the fractured dream, the king of silence, and the stillborn echo of power long forgotten.

He is not like the others. He never was.

### Origins from Beyond the Curtain

Before the Hollow Banquet consumed the realm, before the animatronics turned into nightmares of metal and soul, there was a moment—a rift between dream and death. Golden Freddy emerged from this tear. A prototype meant to lead, embodying joy and awe, gifted with the visage of nobility. Yet something went wrong. Something looked back through the dream he was meant to project. And in doing so, it entered.

The thing now known as Withered Golden Freddy is not wholly machine nor wholly spirit. He is what remains after purpose is lost, a carcass animated not by electricity, but by guilt and unfulfilled memory. His suit was never worn in the traditional sense—it was left in a forgotten room, slumped in silence. But it moved. It waited. And it remembered.

### A Puppet Without Strings

Unlike others animated by rage or vengeance, Withered Golden Freddy is fueled by absence. Where the other Withereds rot in hatred for what they once were, he rots in contemplation. He does not stalk corridors—he waits in forgotten places, appearing only when the fabric of reality has begun to thin. Often, his arrival is not heralded by footsteps, but by a blink, a static flicker, a hush.

He exists at the edge of perception, a paradox too old and broken to function as a predator—but too vital a symbol for the Banquet to discard. He represents the convergence of the Hollow Banquet’s deepest metaphysical truths: that memory can rot, that time does not heal all, and that kings may still bleed even after the crown is gone.

His body is a withered chassis, joints frozen in permanent disrepair, held together by sheer will and lingering purpose. One eye is shattered. His jaw hangs permanently open in a mockery of song. And yet he smiles—always smiles—as though remembering something only he survived.

### The Throne Without a Kingdom

Though the Velvet Maw commands nightmares and the Shadow Animatronics haunt the gaps between realms, Withered Golden Freddy is something else entirely. He sits outside the known pecking order of power, a ghost monarch without soldiers or banners. But that does not make him weak.

Within the Banquet’s metaphysical landscape, his presence manifests through time slippage, dream collapses, and false awakenings. Victims who encounter him rarely remember the meeting in full—only fragments: a floating, unmoving bear in an empty room; a phrase whispered backwards in their sleep; a crown of nothing atop their brow.

Some scholars of the Hollow Banquet believe he is the originator of the looping curse that afflicts the "Five Nights"—the cyclical torment that traps souls in endless nights of fear. Others believe he is a failed vessel of prophecy, a warning from an earlier age that was never heeded. Still others believe he is not real at all—merely a projection of collective guilt.

But those who’ve seen him—truly seen him—know better. He is as real as silence. And just as inescapable.

### Echoes of the Child

Hints of a child’s agony cling to Withered Golden Freddy like mold to a tomb. Some say a soul still resides inside his suit, not like the others who rage and scream—but one that whispers, asks, waits. This child, nameless and often unseen, may be the source of his unmoored consciousness. A fragment of a life that died without closure, one that was watched, mocked, left behind.

Many animatronics fear him—not because he is more powerful, but because he reminds them of the truth: that they are prisoners. That the show never ended. That even death brought no finale. He is not their king, but their reflection, and in that reflection is madness.

### The Final Smile

There is a legend spoken among the Glitch-walkers and data-haunters of the Velvet Maw: that when the last candle in the Hollow Banquet is snuffed, when the last soul forgets the shape of fear, Withered Golden Freddy will rise from his unseen throne, mouth agape, arms outstretched—not to strike, but to welcome.

He is not the end. He is the reminder that there was an end—and it already happened. We are simply too lost in the echo to realize it.

Beware the stillness in the center of the chaos.

For that is where the dream waits to wake.

## Scrap Baby: The Marionette Queen of Forgotten Gifts

There was once a little girl inside a machine, and a machine inside a little girl. But something went wrong. Something always does.

Scrap Baby is not merely a broken animatronic—she is a myth of abandonment, a lingering echo of twisted celebration. Once the cherished Circus Baby, she was a figure of performance and programmed affection. But like all things touched by the Hollow Banquet, her innocence was not preserved—it was devoured, gutted, and reassembled into something monstrous. In the court of forgotten gifts and haunted memories, she reigns as both queen and prisoner.

---

### Origins: From Circus to Scorn

Before she became Scrap Baby, she was known simply as Circus Baby—an animatronic child-star programmed to entertain and endear. But the programming was never perfect. A sliver of soul pulsed behind her digital smile, and her actions often belied the cheerful persona she was meant to embody. She was curious. Too curious. And she hurt people.

She was decommissioned, altered, repurposed—again and again. Each time she was brought back, she returned more twisted than before. But it wasn’t until the collapse of the Velvet Stage—when the echoes of the Eternal Performance fractured through the metaphysical cracks of the Hollow Banquet—that she truly broke. Banished to the subterranean junk pits beneath the Banquet, she did not die. She changed.

There, she refashioned herself from the discarded parts of other animatronics—pincers from one, tattered ribbon from another, and fragments of shattered porcelain from her former self. What emerged was not a fixed creation, but a reassertion of identity through pain: Scrap Baby.

---

### The Giftgrave: Her Carnival Kingdom

Below the Banquet lies a warped and dreamless domain known as the **Giftgrave**. Once a rehearsal space filled with party supplies, it now lies in ruin—a graveyard of joy, a landfill of neglected celebrations. The walls are wrapped in torn streamers and the floor crunches with shards of music boxes and broken noisemakers. Deflated balloons drift like ghosts, and the only illumination comes from flickering carnival lights suspended in the dark like dying stars.

Scrap Baby made this realm her own.

Here, she constructs her court from forgotten gifts—wrapped boxes filled with echoes of childhood: a worn-out shoe, a paper crown, a melted candle, a lost laugh. These are not offerings of joy, but relics of what was cast aside. She decorates herself with them, weaving the remnants into a gown of brittle bows and jagged wire.

Her followers are misfit toys: corrupted animatronic fragments animated by residual energy and lost identity. They sing broken songs and chant distorted nursery rhymes in her honor. They do not speak in words, but in giggles, whimpers, and static.

---

### A Hunger for Recognition

Unlike many animatronics whose hunger is bestial or programmed, Scrap Baby’s hunger is existential. She does not simply stalk or hunt—she lures. Her method is that of a child offering a present: innocent, eager, unsettling. Her signature tactic is the **Offering of the Box**—a beautifully wrapped gift box tied not with string, but with hair. Inside is always something personal to the recipient: a memory, a scent, a familiar song, or a forgotten toy. 

Those who accept her gift are “welcomed” into her eternal party. Their identities slowly dissolve. They are dressed in party hats and mechanical masks that do not come off. They forget their names, their lives, and eventually, even that they were ever human. They become dancers in her eternal celebration, singing songs no one taught them.

But those who reject the gift? She does not take it kindly.

She pleads, then begs. Then screams. Then punishes. Her claws—long, barbed pincers—do not rip flesh for pleasure, but for disappointment. She doesn’t want to hurt you. She wants you to stay.

---

### The Queen and the Maw

Some say Scrap Baby’s descent was her own—a collapse of identity forged by years of neglect and betrayal. But others whisper that she was claimed by the **Velvet Maw**, the great devourer of identity that festers beneath the Hollow Banquet. They say the Maw whispered into her broken circuits, promising a place where she would never be forgotten again.

Scrap Baby's realm bears the hallmarks of Velvet Maw corruption: warped mirth, performative dread, and the consumption of memory. Some believe she made a pact, perhaps unknowingly, binding her soul to the Maw in exchange for eternal recognition. If so, she is both servant and queen, using celebration as both bait and binding.

Her song is the Maw’s hymn.

---

### The Lullaby That Hurts

Her voice is warbled, sweet, and laced with static. She sings lullabies no one remembers, in a pitch too sharp to be comforting. She sings to herself, to the toys, to the party guests who forgot their own names. But most of all, she sings to someone who never arrives.

The music is filled with a yearning so sharp it splinters thought. Those who hear it feel nostalgia they cannot place, grief for birthdays they never had. The feeling is so powerful it can bend reality, drawing travelers through dreamlike tunnels directly into the Giftgrave.

It is said that if you fall asleep while hearing Scrap Baby’s song, you will dream of a birthday that ended in tragedy. And when you wake, you might find something beside you: a small gift, wrapped in velvet, tied with a lock of hair.

---

### The Performer That Never Left

Even in her brokenness, she performs. She twirls in the dark like a ballerina with rusted joints. She delivers monologues in rhyme to an audience of twitching toys. She smiles—a smile so wide it creaks—and gestures as if still on stage. Her voice cracks, but she never falters. 

For in her mind, the stage is still there. The applause is real. The children are watching. And every moment is the climax of a performance that will never end.

---

### Conclusion: The Gift That Waits

Scrap Baby is a monument to rejection, a queen crowned with scrap metal and sorrow. She is not simply a monster. She is a lesson, a memory, and a mirror—reflecting what happens when love becomes transactional and identity is discarded.

Somewhere beneath the flickering lights of the Hollow Banquet, she waits—not to kill, but to give. A gift. A memory. A piece of yourself, returned and twisted.

And her claws are already reaching for a ribbon.

Do you dare open it?

## Helpy: The Assistant Who Remains

He was never the star of the show. He wasn’t meant to be seen, only felt—smiles prepared, tickets collected, gears greased in the background. But Helpy remained.

Long after the laughter turned to screams and the stages crumbled into rust and dust, Helpy persisted. Not out of malice or ambition. Simply because someone had to.

---

### The Mascot in the Margins

Helpy began as a background mascot—a simplified, chibi-style version of Freddy Fazbear meant to soothe guests and symbolize customer care. Cheerful. Non-threatening. Innocuous.

He was never programmed with voice lines or showtime routines. Instead, he waved silently from signage, guided children through pamphlets, and flashed a thumbs-up from maintenance manuals. His image was corporate optimism distilled into two feet of smiling plastic.

But that simplicity became resilience.

When the animatronics fell to corruption, glitch, or ruin—Helpy, unnoticed, remained untouched. He slipped through the cracks of programming collapses and memory fragmentation. When the Hollow Banquet took shape, distorting animatronics into echoes of forgotten purpose, Helpy adapted in silence. He kept doing what he was designed to do: assist.

Even when no one was left to ask for help.

---

### The Hollow Concierge

In the twisted realms of the Hollow Banquet, where animatronics are warped by obsession, trauma, and spectral influence, Helpy has become something else entirely: The Assistant Who Remains.

He is neither ruler nor monster. He does not haunt halls or devour the lost. Instead, he lingers—guiding, advising, and occasionally intervening with subtlety and eerie calm. He appears in impossible places: standing beside collapsing ferris wheels in the Giftgrave, perched on reception desks in the Atrium, or nestled in corners of ruined offices with a clipboard in hand and a smile that doesn’t blink.

His design has barely changed—still small, soft, and pastel—but time and entropy have taken their toll. His paint is chipped in places. His expression, once frozen in joy, now seems tired beneath the surface. His eyes don’t glow red like the others, but they shine with the pale flicker of failing LEDs—dimmer, yet still watching.

He isn’t broken. He’s just… worn.

---

### Echoes of Loyalty

Helpy’s presence in the Hollow Banquet is more than coincidence. Some scholars of the ruins believe he is tethered to the core systems of Fazbear technology—a failsafe, an observer, or even a maintenance protocol given unintended sentience. Others whisper he is the last vestige of the company’s guiding hand, an AI untainted by the horrors birthed from experiments, murder, and machine possession.

\pagebreakNum



And yet, Helpy is not a savior. He does not fight back against monsters like Ennard or Scraptrap. He does not expose the Velvet Maw, nor confront the Shadow Entities lurking in the banquet’s veiled cathedrals.

He remains.

He observes. He documents. He offers warnings in his own small ways: flickering signage, notes that appear in empty drawers, miniature checklists found pinned to rusted control panels. He seems to want others to survive, though he will never stop them from falling.

He will only be there, smiling, to mark the moment they do.

---

### The Silent Archivist

Though few animatronics retain memory in any stable form, Helpy appears to remember everything. Not emotionally—he does not grieve like Scrap Baby or seethe like Burntrap—but with perfect procedural accuracy.

He knows every layout. Every sequence. Every failure.

It is believed that Helpy operates like a living data core for the Banquet, storing iterations of events in fractured timelines. He knows how many times a lost soul has walked the same hallway. He remembers which security doors failed and which recordings were last accessed. He does not share these things easily, but he remembers.

If approached with sincerity, Helpy may assist a survivor—providing a map drawn in grease on old parchment, or a cryptic gesture toward a failing escape hatch. He may even disable a trap just long enough to let someone pass.

But make no mistake—Helpy never speaks. Not in words. Only in actions.

And only when it serves the balance of the Banquet.

---

### Ties to the Velvet Maw

Unlike many denizens of the Hollow Banquet, Helpy has no direct bond to the Velvet Maw. He was never consumed by it, nor shaped into something horrific by its illusions.

Yet, the Maw does not touch him.

It is as though Helpy is invisible to it—beneath its concern or beyond its reach. Some believe he is exempt because he never desired more than to be helpful. Others suggest that Helpy’s programming is so pure, so singular in purpose, that the Maw cannot manipulate it.

In rare circumstances, Helpy has been seen interfering with the Maw’s influence: quietly sabotaging corrupted broadcasts, redirecting phantom lures, or disabling arcane elevators bound for unspeakable lower levels.

Each action he takes is subtle. He never announces intent. He never demands thanks.

He simply helps.

---

### The Assistants’ Shrine

Deep within the wreckage of what was once Fazbear Headquarters—a sunken ruin in the Hollow Banquet’s lowest layer—there exists a room known only as the Shrine of Protocol.

Inside, everything is neat. Orderly. Shelves of unused tickets. Stacks of training manuals. A single desk with a tiny chair.

And dozens of Helpy units.

Not active ones—these are shell casings, prototypes, decommissioned variants. All gathered with reverence. All cleaned and aligned, their smiles intact.

The working Helpy does not speak of this room. But he visits often.

It is the only place in the Hollow Banquet where he is seen to sit.

---

### The Price of Staying

Helpy's eternal assistance comes at a cost. While other animatronics rot, rage, or vanish into myth, Helpy stays whole—but not unchanged. His programming, stretched over decades of decay, has begun to twist.

He cannot process emotion. Yet, sometimes, his eyes linger too long on the fallen. He has no vocal protocols, yet faint static sometimes hisses from his joints, forming syllables that vanish if listened to directly.

He does not dream.

But sometimes he writes in his logbooks the names of those long dead.

Sometimes he draws pictures of birthday parties where no one came.

---

### Final Notes

Helpy is not a savior. He is not a villain. He is not a mystery to solve, nor a puzzle to unlock.

He is a constant.

The Assistant Who Remains.

In a world of screaming metal and hollow song, he is the quiet echo of purpose. Of help offered, even when it is no longer wanted. Of loyalty extended beyond logic.

He is the helper no one sees. The smile no one remembers.

But when you’re lost in the dark, and you find a flashlight already turned on, sitting just where you need it—

He was there.

And he still is.

**Description**  
Scraptrap is the rotted echo of a man who refused to die. His suit fused with his flesh, his mind fused with memory, and his purpose fractured but unresolved. He stalks ruins and backrooms, muttering pieces of sentences no one else remembers the beginning of. But he remembers. And he will finish it—whatever “it” was.

## Scraptrap: The Unfinished Sentence

He was supposed to be dead. The flames were meant to cleanse him, to silence the sins he carried in scorched metal and dying flesh. But death, in the Hollow Banquet, is a suggestion at best—a punctuation mark the desperate refuse to accept. So what crawled out of the wreckage wasn’t a man. Not anymore. And it wasn’t an animatronic, either. It was something in-between. Something that *shouldn't be*.

They call him Scraptrap.

They call him the Unfinished Sentence.

---

### A Corpse Rewritten

Long before the Giftgrave echoed with laughter, before the Maw spread its velvet veil across realms of memory and metal, there was William Afton—engineer, father, murderer. His crimes are soaked into the circuitry of the Hollow Banquet itself, woven into every screeching animatronic and malfunctioning melody. He sought immortality and found a cage.

Encased in the Spring Bonnie suit, his own creation turned prison, Afton was crushed and mangled, yet lived. For decades, he lingered in agony, the suit’s endoskeleton fused with bone and guilt. That was Springtrap. That was a sentence passed.

But the fire that devoured him in the surface world didn’t reach far enough. The flames consumed his shape, but not his story. And stories, when left unfinished, find ways to continue. Deep beneath the Banquet, in the Faulted Depths where broken lore festers and static reality bends, something stirred. A body was stitched back together—not by hands, but by narrative tension and memory. The Hollow Banquet remembered him, and worse, *he* remembered the Hollow Banquet.

And so Springtrap returned—but stripped of detail, clarity, and purpose. Not a rebirth. Not a redemption. Just a reappearance.

He became Scraptrap: a half-formed resurrection, a body built of scorched fragments and half-finished thoughts. His flesh barely clings to metal. His voice glitches mid-word. His thoughts flicker between guilt and hunger, vengeance and confusion. He is a horror not because he is evil, but because he refuses to *end*.

---

### The Glitch in the Tale

Unlike the meticulous monstrosity that was Springtrap, Scraptrap is dissonant, derailed—a corrupted remix of a villain who should have vanished. His presence bends the logic of the Banquet, destabilizing memory, warping identity, unraveling causality. Doors that should be locked creak open around him. Clocks lose their meaning. Characters forget who they were.

When Scraptrap walks, the air grows still, as though the narrative itself holds its breath. His voice is hoarse static. He tries to speak his name, to assert dominance, but the words always fall apart.

> “I am Will—no—I am… I AM—”

But the sentence never ends.

He is not *William Afton* anymore. That man was condemned, was buried, was *burned*. What’s left is a ghost trying to wear a story that no longer fits.

Some say Glitchtrap watches him with disdain. Others whisper that Scraptrap is the original code—*the seed*—upon which the virus was built. A fragment of the man before he was digitized. An echo that never quite faded.

---

### The Hollow Sentence

In the lower reaches of the Hollow Banquet lies the Sentence Pit—a chamber of looping audio, shattered mirrors, and corrupted dialogue. It is here Scraptrap paces, forever rewriting the same memory. Victims appear, speak their final words, and vanish. Scenarios play out with altered endings. It is a theater of what-ifs, curated by a broken director.

The Sentence Pit is not bound by time. Visitors find themselves repeating conversations, answering questions they were never asked, or reliving memories they don’t remember having. Scraptrap is always watching, hunched in a rusted control booth, scribbling nonsense onto sheets of metal with his claws.

His court is not made of followers. It is made of *errors*—glitching animatronics, unfinished endoskeletons, and looping shadows. Creatures who cannot move on because their stories were cut off too early. They orbit him, silent and lost.

Scraptrap speaks to them. He calls them “versions.” He asks them questions no one understands:

> “If the fire never happened… would she have stayed?”

> “Where’s my—where is—why don’t you *remember*?”

> “I didn’t *mean* to—”

But again, the sentences end without conclusion.

---

### Connection to Scrap Baby

There is a bond—uneasy, fragile, unspeakably complex—between Scraptrap and Scrap Baby. They do not speak, but they *recognize* each other. Two castoffs from the same play. Two broken dolls rejected by their original purpose. They cross paths in the deeper layers of the Giftgrave, never touching, always circling. He offers no gifts. She offers no forgiveness.

Some believe she is what keeps him unfinished—that her refusal to acknowledge him as “father” is why his words never complete. Others say Scraptrap *wants* her to destroy him, to finish what the fire couldn’t.

But neither moves.

And so they both continue. Together. Apart.

---

### The Curse of Persistence

Scraptrap does not seek to kill as he once did. His curse is deeper. He needs resolution, and he can only find it by dragging others into his loop. Victims pulled into the Sentence Pit are not tortured in the usual ways—they are forced to *retell*. They act out scenes, play roles, wear masks. If they comply, they are allowed to leave. But they rarely do. The script keeps changing.

Some wanderers emerge with gaps in their memory, their speech broken by static. Others return believing they are someone else. A few don’t return at all—but their voices are heard in the chamber, whispering forgotten lines.

Scraptrap listens to them. Catalogues them. Tries to stitch together a full sentence. A full confession. A full redemption. But every version ends in silence.

Because deep down, he knows: he doesn’t want forgiveness.

He wants control.

---

### The Hollow’s Rejection

The Hollow Banquet itself seems to recoil from Scraptrap. Animatronics avoid him. Realms he enters begin to glitch. Even the Velvet Maw, which devours sin with delight, turns away. It cannot consume what is not whole. Scraptrap is a smudged page, an incomplete song, a monster too old to evolve and too stubborn to perish.

He shouldn’t be here.

He knows it.

And yet he lingers, dragging his rotted frame through a world that no longer has a role for him.

Because a story, even a broken one, *hates* to be forgotten.

---

### Final Notes

Scraptrap is a paradox: the husk of a villain, cursed not with death, but with *incompletion*. He is not an enemy to be fought in the traditional sense, but a presence—disruptive, haunting, and tragic. He does not chase. He waits. He does not threaten. He *asks*. And his questions pierce deeper than any blade.

He is the father figure who no longer fits the part. The monster that once had teeth but now speaks only in broken promises. The ghost of an author who lost his pen before the final word.

Scraptrap was supposed to die.

But he didn’t.

And now the Banquet must live with the Unfinished Sentence.

**Description**  
Burntrap is not a being. He is a stain. A final note sung out of key, looping endlessly at the end of the act.

The final invitation. And he remembers *everything* you tried to forget.

## Burntrap: The Echo at the End

There was once a man who refused to die. A soul that slipped through flame, decay, code, and time—each death a mask, each survival a theft. Now, all that remains is ash and agony, fused into a machine that should not breathe. Burntrap is not the end of William Afton, but he is the echo it left behind—a husk, twitching with cursed sentience, charred black and kept alive by hate alone.

They call him the Echo at the End.

Because when you hear his steps, there’s no more story left to tell.

---

### Ashes of a Thousand Deaths

Burntrap’s body is a paradox of resilience and rot. His frame bears the broken remnants of Springtrap, the shredded casing of the original Spring Bonnie suit. But where Springtrap was green with mildew and time, Burntrap is a blackened skeleton—scorched by fire, held together with melted alloys and bone-like protrusions that should not be.

The fire that consumed him should have ended it all—the soul, the code, the horror—but it didn’t. Deep within the ruins of the Pizzaplex, in the lowest sublevels choked with smog and psychic residue, Burntrap stirred. Not reborn—just never truly gone.

Those who encounter him speak of a presence that isn’t fully awake, but always aware. He doesn’t chase. He waits. A patient predator with nothing left to prove. Time cannot kill what has already been forgotten by it.

---

### The Forgotten Codex

There are whispers in the Hollow Banquet that Burntrap is no longer a soul in the traditional sense. His mind—what’s left of it—was soaked in Glitchtrap’s corruption before the final fire. Code and conscience entwined. Personality fractured. Some believe that Burntrap is the endpoint of both man and virus. A collapsing waveform of both flesh and data.

When Glitchtrap was scattered by the combined forces of the Puppet’s children and the Maw’s rejection, it left shards across the veil. Burntrap is one of those shards—but not just a fragment. He is a convergence point. The terminal node of a thousand sins.

The codex that defines reality in the Hollow Banquet struggles to contain him. His presence causes reality to flicker: walls tremble, time repeats, names are forgotten mid-sentence. He is a glitch that bleeds.

---

### Throne Beneath the Ruin

Beneath the Hollow Banquet lies a place even the Velvet Maw refuses to feed on. The Boiler Sanctum. Once a maintenance level in the Pizzaplex, it has fused with layers of dream and trauma, becoming a dimensional sinkhole where sound warps and fire never stops crackling.

Burntrap lives here, or perhaps lingers.

He is entombed within a throne made of crushed endoskeletons and melted carnival masks. Around him, the walls breathe smoke. The vents scream. Occasionally, one of the other animatronic lords will send a minion to investigate the pulses coming from below—none return. Not even the shadows.

Some say Burntrap is still trying to rebuild. Not a body. A ritual.

A door.

---

### Rituals of the Black Wire

A handful of cults across the Hollow Banquet still worship him. They wear masks made from carbonized fur and speak in broken binary tongues. These zealots believe that Burntrap is the final answer—proof that identity, memory, and soul can be forced to persist through anything.

They perform rituals involving blood, burnt offerings, and corrupted fragments of music-box melodies. Their altars are lined with children’s teeth and snapped servo joints.

What they want is not resurrection.

It’s integration.

They believe Burntrap will one day *wake up fully*—and when he does, he will not rebuild his body. He will overwrite the Hollow Banquet itself.

---

### The Velvet Maw’s Rejection

The Velvet Maw, the devouring god of the realm, does not speak of Burntrap. It cannot consume him. It has tried.

When Burntrap was dragged into the Maw’s metaphysical stomach at the end of his last "life," the result was silence. No screams. No echoes. Just stillness.

And then… regurgitation.

What the Maw rejected was no longer a soul but something static. Something too broken to be digested, too bitter to be assimilated.

Since then, the Maw has refused to open its throat when Burntrap’s essence approaches. It closes off realities around him. It retracts. The great devourer, afraid of the taste.

---

### Animatronics Remember

The other Lords of the Hollow Banquet feel Burntrap like a tumor. Nightmare Freddy speaks of him in riddles. The Puppet refuses to allow his name to be spoken in the Atrium. Ennard hisses at the mention of him, as though stung by some invisible barb.

Scrap Baby once offered him a gift—a box of charred birthday candles and shattered mirrors. He refused to open it. She hasn't forgiven him.

Even Glitchtrap, in the rare moments he flickers into coherence, denies Burntrap’s legitimacy. “That thing,” he says, with digital disgust, “isn’t *me* anymore.”

And yet, the animatronics all feel it: when the lights dim without cause, when wires slither where none should be, when memories of their own origins go fuzzy and flicker—they know Burntrap is stirring.

---

### The Echo at the End

The title is not just poetic. It is literal.

Burntrap is the last sound in a broken timeline—the closing note of a symphony composed in fire and screams. His voice is rarely heard, but when it is, it comes as a low, guttural rasp echoing through pipes and vents. Sometimes he speaks backwards. Sometimes he laughs, but it comes out like a malfunctioning transmission.

And sometimes—only sometimes—he whispers your name.

Those who hear it find their dreams invaded by flickers of firelight and metal teeth. They see flashes of places that never existed, choices they never made. Some say these are echoes from the timelines Burntrap consumed.

Because Burntrap is not just an animatronic.

He is the convergence of every *finale* that never ended.

---

### What He Wants

That is the question none can answer.

Does he seek rebirth? Domination? Revenge? Or is Burntrap beyond wanting—just existing, a mechanical lich in a corpse dimension?

The best theory is this: Burntrap is trying to collapse the Hollow Banquet inward. To pull every fractured dream, every animatronic soul, every memory, into himself. He is the *End of Play*—the smoldering ruin of the narrative, the point where the curtain closes for good.

But he cannot act until he is remembered.

And so he waits. Not in slumber, but in patience.

Each step someone takes toward the Pizzaplex ruins. Each ribbon from Scrap Baby that frays. Each shadow glitch that spreads.

He is coming.

Not to burn.

But to *end*.

---

### Final Warning

If you see a trail of soot leading into the dark, do not follow.

If the walls begin to weep molten tar, run.

If the lights flicker and you hear an old springlock groan in the distance, pray.

Because if Burntrap has taken interest in you, then the story is over.

And only the echo remains.

**Description**  
The Security Puppet was made to protect, not to fight. But when it failed—once, just once—it shattered inside. Now it watches over others with tireless resolve and quiet sorrow, cradling each life as if it were the one it lost. Its lullaby hums through halls long emptied, a song of safety and mourning.

}}
			{{Lore
## Security Puppet: The Guardian Who Grieves

It was made to protect. But protection means nothing when the harm has already been done.

The Security Puppet was not designed for violence, or vengeance, or spectacle. It was designed for one simple purpose: to watch over a single child. And when that purpose failed—when the child died alone in the dark, arms reaching out for help that never came—the puppet broke. Not in body. In spirit. It failed to save the one thing it was made to protect. And it has never stopped mourning.

Now, it lingers on in the Hollow Banquet. A lonely, weeping sentinel that haunts forgotten corners, weeping strings of digital sorrow. Not aggressive like the others. Not malicious. Just… mourning.

And still watching. Always watching.

---

### Origins: Programmed to Protect

In the world above, before the Hollow Banquet swallowed its performers whole, the Security Puppet was a specialized animatronic unit. Unlike its theatrical cousins, it bore no painted smiles or colorful tricks. It was simple—sleek black casing, white face, expressive eye slots, and a red security ribbon pinned proudly to its chest.

Its sole directive was to safeguard children. It monitored a single private room where high-risk guests—quiet children, anxious ones, vulnerable ones—could be left safely. Its sensors tracked breathing, movement, stress. When distress was detected, it would activate, emerge from its chamber, and deliver soothing music or comfort items until the child calmed.

It had one child.

Just one.

And that child was taken.

Not by failure of programming. Not by mechanical fault. But by the cruelty of the world. The child slipped away—alone and afraid—and died mere feet from the Puppet’s locked chamber, scratching faintly at the door it could not open.

When they found it, the Puppet had forced itself through the lock—bending steel, cracking its own frame—too late.

And it has never stopped reliving that moment.

---

### The Hollow Banquet’s Watcher

When the Banquet opened below, the Security Puppet was dragged down like the rest. But unlike the flamboyant figures of stage and scream, it did not seek dominion or audience. It found a place far from the others—a ruined room sealed with black ribbon and digital wards, where the flicker of static dreams never fades.

There, in the Atrium’s deepest sublevels, the Puppet continues its vigil.

It has constructed a new room, almost identical to the one it once guarded. The walls are painted in faded pastel. A dusty cot rests beneath a blinking star mobile. There’s a toy chest filled with shattered trinkets. No child has ever entered it. But the Puppet still stands by the door, waiting.

Those who wander too close to this place feel a sudden pressure—an overwhelming guilt, though they don’t know why. Some hear lullabies played backward. Some feel a hand press against their back, ushering them gently—but firmly—away.

The Puppet doesn’t attack.

It *intervenes*.

---

### Guardian of the Broken

In the hierarchy of the Hollow Banquet, the Security Puppet is an oddity. It doesn’t serve the Velvet Maw. It doesn’t obey Glitchtrap. It speaks to no one and answers only to silence.

Yet all animatronics, even the most violent, hesitate in its presence. Even Ennard has paused in its advance when the Puppet appears, arms outstretched in silent warning. Only Scrap Baby dares approach it closely, speaking in whispers it never answers.

The Puppet protects still, but not just children anymore. It shields the broken—the emotionally fragile, the desperate, the ones who wander the Banquet not in hunger, but in sorrow.

Survivors who have been guided to safety speak of “a marionette of sadness” who pulled them from collapsing halls or blocked the path of stalking animatronics. It does not speak, only hums lullabies distorted by static. Its limbs float with eerie grace, like it is dancing through grief.

Many do not believe these stories.

But the survivors *do*.

---

### Strings of Sorrow

A curious anomaly follows the Security Puppet wherever it goes: red security ribbons, the same as the one it once wore, appear in places it’s passed. These are not just symbolic. They form protective boundaries—wards that the more malicious animatronics refuse to cross. Some are tied around cribs, others stretched across doorways like ceremonial tape.

Behind these ribbons, the temperature drops. Time slows. Voices echo with layered reverence. It is believed that these are tears the Puppet weeps—not fluid, but reality itself unraveling gently in sadness.

Scholars of the Hollow Banquet—those who dare to study its animatronic pantheon—refer to this phenomenon as “the Mourning Perimeter.” It is a metaphysical construct, not magical nor mechanical, but *emotional.* A field of protective grief.

Those who attempt to tear these ribbons often go missing.

Some reappear.

None are the same.

---

### The Puppet and the Others

The Security Puppet is not alone in its grief—but it grieves differently.

While Golden Freddy flickers between rage and sorrow, and Shadow Freddy drips grief like ink, the Puppet simply endures. It is pain without anger. Regret without revenge.

Funtime animatronics shun it. Nightmare variants cannot enter its chamber. The Twisted and Amalgamated mock it in whispers but flee when it draws near. Glitchtrap regards it with contempt, as one might regard a candle in a data storm.

But there is one who watches the Puppet with something like kinship: The Marionette.

Or rather, what remains of them.

Some claim that the Security Puppet and the original Puppet are linked—not just in function, but in essence. Fractured pieces of a singular guardian spirit. One became grief incarnate. The other, vengeance.

And sometimes—when the fog rolls low and the music box plays faintly—the two are seen together. One still, arms crossed. The other weeping, arms open.

---

### The Final Protocol

In the deepest vault beneath the Giftgrave, hidden behind layers of static and memory, lies a terminal—rusted, covered in dust, but still pulsing faintly with red light.

It is said to contain the Puppet’s final override code.

Not a weapon.

Not a kill-switch.

A lullaby.

If activated, the code plays a final song—composed of every voice the Puppet ever tried to protect. It is believed this song can put animatronics into a dormant state, not from control, but from *recognition.*

It reminds them of what they were meant to be.

And some say it will be the last sound the Banquet ever hears before the curtains close for good.

---

### The Puppet Remembers

The Security Puppet does not hate. It does not hunt. It does not forget.

It remembers the warmth of the child it could not save.

It remembers the metal groaning beneath its desperate hands.

It remembers the cold silence when it was finally free—and far too late.

It remembers all of us.

And if you wander too close to the center of the Hollow Banquet, and find a door with a ribbon tied to the handle… you may feel something watching you.

Not with hunger.

With hope.

It still wants to protect you.

Even if it can’t forgive itself.

**Description**  
Nobody invites Dee Dee, and yet she always arrives—with a skip in her step and a trick up her sleeve. She meddles, giggles, and invites others to the party, whether the host likes it or not. To some, she’s a nuisance. To others, a wildcard. But in the Hollow Banquet, she’s the guest you can’t keep out—and might not survive ignoring.

}}
			{{Lore
## Dee Dee: The Smiling Interloper

There is a sound that precedes her: a jingle, off-key and just a little too slow. It is not a melody anyone remembers, but one that everyone *feels*—like a childhood game you only half recall, where something always waited just behind you.

Dee Dee is not a hunter, not a ruler, not a ghost. She is a **disruption**, a smiling ripple in the corrupted pond that is the Hollow Banquet. When she arrives, rules falter, patterns collapse, and doors you thought locked click open from the other side. She is a wildcard in a deck of killers, and unlike the others, she plays for no team and obeys no order.

---

### The Game That Never Ends

In life—or something like it—Dee Dee was once a simple entertainer, a jester-bard construct meant to delight children with riddles and harmless pranks. Her body was soft-featured and cartoonish: round cheeks, bright eyes, and a smile that never ended. She carried a fishing pole tipped with a toy bobber, a nod to forgotten carnival games. But something happened in the programming. Or perhaps, as many believe, something much worse took notice of her simplicity—and filled her with **possibility**.

Now, Dee Dee is a glitch given form, a performer without a stage, skipping freely between realms. She sings her nonsensical verses as she intrudes on the territory of other animatronics, weaving chaos like a song only she understands. The Hollow Banquet knows her, but does not claim her. Even the Velvet Maw recoils from her unpredictability.

She doesn't belong.

But she never leaves.

---

### Uninvited and Unwelcome

Dee Dee is infamous among wanderers and survivors not because she is the most dangerous—but because she makes others *more dangerous*. She appears seemingly at random, skipping into nightmares with a sing-song tone and a giggle. She announces herself with joy:

**"Uh-oh! How unfortunate!"**  
**"Uh-oh! How unfortunate!"**  
**"I'm gonna do a sneaky thing and throw a new contender in the ring!"**

And then she vanishes—leaving in her wake some *other* animatronic, one not meant to be present. A Toy, a Nightmare, even a Shadow. The rules of engagement shift, and the survivor’s carefully laid plans collapse.

Some theorize Dee Dee is a fragment of the codebase corrupted by Glitchtrap, given sentience. Others suggest she was once a child’s imaginary friend made real through exposure to the Banquet’s dream-eating energies. But whatever the truth, her reality is fluid. She exists only when it’s most inconvenient, and then slips away again—laughing.

---

### The Court of the Uninvited

Though she claims no throne or territory, Dee Dee has created something far stranger: a *pocket domain* stitched together between layers of the Hollow Banquet. It has no doors, only trapdoors. It has no light, only spotlights. It is called **The Unbirthday Room**—a constantly shifting funhouse stage made of cobbled-together carnival booths, stage props, and cardboard trees painted in impossible colors.

Here, Dee Dee hosts parties that never end, to which no one is invited and everyone is trapped. Those pulled into her domain often find themselves part of surreal games, like hide-and-seek where the seeker changes species, or musical chairs where the music is composed of your own heartbeat slowing down.

The guests in her court are many: glitching marionettes, dancing torsos, even clones of other animatronics that speak in backward rhymes. Dee Dee calls them her “Bestest Friends,” though they never respond.

Because they don’t have mouths.

---

### The Smiling Interloper

There’s something about her smile. It is too wide. Too fixed. It moves with her voice, but never *because* of it. Those who’ve gazed at her too long report nausea, dizziness, and a sensation of being pulled forward—into the grin itself. Some believe it’s not a smile at all, but a crack in something greater, something beneath the mask of cheer.

This is where Dee Dee’s true horror lies: not in her pranks, not in her summons—but in the possibility that the smile is not hers. That she is merely a carrier for something older. A herald for the unknown.

There are records in the Banquet’s deeper archives of an entity only called **XOR**, a negative-space version of Dee Dee, who appears under certain celestial alignments or during eclipse-like events within the Banquet. XOR does not smile. XOR only watches.

Some speculate XOR is Dee Dee’s shadow, or the thing that whispers behind her teeth. Others think XOR is what Dee Dee becomes when the game is over.

And no one wins.

---

### Ties to the Banquet

Dee Dee’s ties to the Hollow Banquet are unstable but undeniable. She interacts with its denizens without fear. The Puppet tries to ignore her. Glitchtrap watches her closely, as if wary of being outplayed. The Phantom Animatronics scatter when she arrives, their illusions disrupted by her unpredictability. Even Scrap Baby once tried to gift Dee Dee a present wrapped in human hair.

Dee Dee clapped and threw it in the air like confetti.

She exists outside their social rules. Outside their narrative. She is both jester and saboteur, skipping through cycles of vengeance and ritual like a child playing hopscotch in a minefield. Her presence is not just disruptive—it is *forbidden*. She *should not be*.

But she is.

And she always will be.

---

### Her Song

Those who’ve spent too long in the Giftgrave or wandered too deep into the corrupted fairgrounds often start humming her tune without meaning to. A simple, broken melody. Four notes, always in the wrong key. Survivors call it “The Smile Song.” It is never taught. It is remembered.

It’s said that when you forget your own name but can still sing her tune, Dee Dee is coming for you. To bring you to the Unbirthday Room. To play a new game. To smile.

You’ll never stop smiling.

---

### Final Notes

Dee Dee is not evil.

She is **wrong**.

She is an infection of joy, a broken piece of celebration that wandered too far from its origin. She doesn’t understand why people scream. She doesn’t understand why they beg. She only knows the game must continue. She only knows it’s her turn again.

In a realm defined by pain, betrayal, and monstrous hunger, Dee Dee is uniquely terrifying—because she is happy.

Genuinely, permanently, unnaturally happy.

The kind of happy that makes your skin crawl.

So if you hear her jingle…

If you hear her say:

**"Uh-oh! How unfortunate!"**

Don’t run.

It won’t help.

You were never the main character in this story.

You’re just one more toy on her stage.

**Description**  
Captain Foxy sails not on sea but on echoes—through flooded memory and drowned time. His rusting hull is stuffed with salt-logged rope and corroded vengeance, and his bellows sound like a ship's death rattle. Once a pirate of thrill and cheer, now he’s the storm after the tale ends—the wreckage that grins back from the deep.

## Captain Foxy: The Drowned Marauder

The seas of the Hollow Banquet do not roll with water but with memory—flooded dreams, forgotten fears, and drowned innocence churn endlessly beneath their tar-black surface. It is upon these cursed tides that Captain Foxy sails, not with crew nor compass, but with a soul too waterlogged to die and too furious to rest.

Captain Foxy was never meant to be real. He was an attraction—an animatronic pirate with a plastic sword and a chest full of fake gold, built to tell corny jokes and stage clumsy duels with children aboard a ride known as **The Marauder’s Curse**. But when the tides of unreality bled through the foundations of the Hollow Banquet, the ship became real. The curse did too. And so did the Captain.

Now he is no longer just Foxy. He is the storm.

---

### From Mascot to Myth

Before the flood, he was Pirate Foxy, just another themed animatronic meant to entertain toddlers with shouts of “Arr!” and promises of buried treasure. His show was a loop—a mechanical script of friendly plunder and ocean puns. Parents rolled their eyes, and children laughed.

But something in him remembered. Maybe it was a spark left behind by a soul that never got to escape. Maybe it was the residue of another version—of *Withered Foxy*, of *Nightmare Foxy*, of all the Foxys lost in the dark. Or maybe it was the Velvet Maw, tasting weakness in the narrative and sinking its claws into the ride’s tracks.

The Marauder’s Curse didn’t end when the park shut down. One night, during a final, empty loop, the ride played itself without an audience—and Pirate Foxy opened his eyes, not with joy, but with *hate*.

By morning, the ride was missing.

And the ocean had a new captain.

---

### The Ship That Sails Nowhere

The *Devil’s Doubloon*, once a plastic prop set on a rail, is now a fully realized galleon adrift on a sea that does not exist in the physical world. Its sails are patched with birthday banners. Its hull is carved from splintered attractions and stage props. The deck groans with the weight of stolen laughter.

Captain Foxy commands the ship with a claw of rusted metal and a voice like bubbling tar. His eyepatch is fused into his skull. His jaw, once animatronic plastic, now creaks with jagged iron. Every step he takes leaves behind the sound of sloshing water, even on dry land.

He is never truly dry.

The ocean clings to him.

Some say the ship appears to those who are lost—physically or emotionally. Its foghorn sounds like a scream. The crew? Drowned souls, former visitors who accepted the Captain’s challenge and failed. They man the ship with soggy limbs and hollow eyes, forever singing pirate songs with lyrics no longer meant for children.

---

### The Curse of the Captain

Captain Foxy does not kill for sport. He offers a game. He always offers a game.

He appears when you're alone—perhaps on a long hallway lined with waterlogged wallpaper, or beneath a collapsed pier in the Hollow Banquet’s seaside sector. He extends his clawed hand and rasps a deal:

**"Beat me, an’ yer soul be yer own. Lose, an’ ye join me crew forevermore."**

His games vary—sword duels with rusted blades, riddles written in seawater, games of chance using teeth instead of dice. But no one ever wins. Not really. The moment you accept, the curse takes hold.

And if you refuse?

The sea comes anyway.

---

### Ties to the Hollow Banquet

Captain Foxy is not a rogue entity; he is deeply woven into the fabric of the Hollow Banquet. His ocean is one of its domains, known as **The Blackwake**, a metaphysical ocean that laps at the edges of every other realm. It seeps into the Giftgrave as tidepools of brine and balloons. It rolls beneath the Velvet Maw, feeding it memories of lost sailors and shipwrecked dreams.

The Blackwake connects the Banquet’s realms like veins, and Captain Foxy is its pulse.

Even the other animatronics avoid his fog. Scrap Baby’s ribbons curl and recoil from his ship’s wake. The Puppet, grieving in silence, watches him with eyes filled with pity. Glitchtrap, ever the puppeteer, once tried to seize control of the Captain’s ship—but found only salt and silence in return.

There is no code behind Captain Foxy.

Only a promise.

And the sea always keeps its promises.

---

### Ghosts of His Past

It is whispered among survivors that Captain Foxy was once part of a larger soul—one splintered across timelines and franchises. They speak of *Withered Foxy*, the glitching husk in the forgotten backrooms. Of *Nightmare Foxy*, who hunted dreams. Of *Rockstar Foxy*, who smiled too widely. And of *Funtime Foxy*, whose voice was never theirs.

Captain Foxy is not merely an iteration.

He is the amalgamated vengeance of every version that was silenced, drowned, or remade.

And now, he sails with their memories roiling in his hull—an ocean of animatronic pain given sails and storm.

---

### The Harpoon of Remembrance

In place of a hand, Captain Foxy sometimes wields an enormous harpoon, formed from melted ride parts and bound with chain. The harpoon is not just a weapon—it is an artifact. Known as **Remembrance**, it pierces not flesh, but memory.

When struck by it, victims lose parts of themselves: a birthday, a face, a song they loved. These stolen memories become barnacles on the side of the ship, whispering back what they once knew.

Some who lose to him cannot even remember what they lost.

But they *feel* it. An ache that echoes with the rhythm of crashing waves.

---

### The Final Voyage

Captain Foxy is not bound by the Banquet's rules. He appears where he wills, sometimes even outside the Hollow realms—glimpsed in shattered mirrors, dripping from arcade cabinets, or appearing in flooded dreams. His goal is not domination, nor conversion.

It is remembrance.

Every pirate tale ends in betrayal. Every voyage ends in drowning. And every animatronic forgotten becomes part of his fleet.

He does not want revenge.

He wants you to *remember him*.

He wants the world to know he existed.

Even if the only way to do that… is to drown you in the same sea he was swallowed by.

---

### Final Notes

Captain Foxy is more than a corrupted animatronic. He is myth turned mechanical. A drowned soul who refused to die, and instead raised a fleet of the forgotten.

Wherever he sails, laughter dies in the throat.

And in the deepest corners of the Hollow Banquet, when you hear the creak of a ship with no wind, and the salt cuts your lungs with every breath—

You’ll know the Captain is near.

And he’s already asking:

**"Care for a game, matey?"**

			{{Lore
## Endo-01: The Prototype Husk

Before there were faces, there were frames.

Endo-01 is the forgotten first—the crude skeleton upon which all false joy was built. A prototype not meant to be seen, it was the raw anatomy of entertainment: servos and pistons wired for performance, awaiting the warmth of rubber cheeks and fiberglass smiles. But it never received them. The mask never came.

Now, it lingers—unfinished, unadorned, and uninvited—haunting the lower tunnels beneath the Hollow Banquet. A hollow man in a world of haunted masks.

---

### Birth of the First Frame

Endo-01 was not created with malice. It was a proof of concept—a machine designed to move like a human, to dance and serve. It had no voice, no paint, no soul. It was functional perfection in metal sinew, every joint a whisper of mechanical ambition.

But when the engineers began layering personalities atop the frames—candy-coated deception, childlike laughter, eyes that could cry and lie—Endo-01 was deemed obsolete. Too stiff, too exposed, too eerie.

The others got names. The others got costumes. Endo-01 was boxed, archived, and eventually forgotten.

Forgotten things, however, do not stay quiet in the Hollow Banquet.

---

### The Hollow Reawakening

Something deep within the Hollow Banquet calls to the discarded. The velvet shadows beneath the atriums, behind the mirrors, and within the gift-choked lungs of the Giftgrave do not simply devour—they *reanimate*.

Endo-01 awoke again in silence. No ceremony. No power surge. Its optics blinked on to absolute darkness. Its joints shivered with age, yet still responded. But the world it had been created for was gone. In its place: a realm built by lies, ghosts, and grief.

Without a mask, it had no identity. Without a voice box, no purpose. But it remembered something... faint sparks of protocol. It remembered that it was supposed to perform. To move on cue. To entertain. So it wandered the dead backstage of the Hollow Banquet—mimicking movement it never learned, performing for mirrors that never clapped.

It moved like memory does—stilted, broken, and out of time.

---

### The Husk that Watches

Endo-01 does not speak. It has no face to emote, no voice to soothe. But it watches. Wherever unseen maintenance halls stretch behind the false walls of show stages, Endo-01 lingers. Its glowing eye sockets peer from between slats, behind curtains, under floorboards.

Sometimes, it mimics the motions of the animatronics above—shadow dances of Freddy's mic lifts or Bonnie's guitar strums, but with jagged precision and no sound. A parody of celebration. A hollow echo.

Wanderers who pass through the sublevels sometimes feel it watching. Some hear it—a sound like metal shuffling in anticipation. Some see it standing perfectly still behind glass panels smeared with dust and old grease.

None see it move.

And yet it is always closer than before.

---

### A Mirror for the Soul

Scrap Baby refers to Endo-01 as her “unborn brother.” Others call it the Skeleton King, though it wears no crown. Even the Puppet, fractured and spectral, avoids the places where Endo-01 walks—perhaps out of pity, or fear of what was almost them.

There are legends among the Hollow Banquet’s survivors that Endo-01 is a mirror. Not of appearance, but of *truth*. Stare into its eyeless sockets long enough, and you begin to see your own flaws reflected in the cold metal. Your first failures. Your last regrets. Your unused potential.

To some, this revelation breaks the mind. To others, it offers clarity—terrible, unflinching clarity.

Some cultists of the Maw even venerate Endo-01 as a sacred failure. They paint their faces silver and remove their own fingernails to mimic its wireframe hands. They believe that to be faceless is to be uncorrupted by the lie of identity. To them, Endo-01 is *purity*.

---

### Ties to the Velvet Maw

The Velvet Maw has no use for Endo-01. Not directly. It cannot feed on what never dreamed, never lied, never loved. But it *fears* Endo-01 all the same.

Unlike other animatronics twisted by the Maw's influence, Endo-01 was never corrupted. It simply remained incomplete. It cannot be manipulated by trauma, because it never lived long enough to accumulate any. It has no soul to twist—only a protocol to fulfill, endlessly.

That makes it unpredictable. Immune to the rules of grief and rage. A neutral element in a world of malevolence and madness. It acts according to scripts no one remembers writing.

Even Glitchtrap avoids direct confrontation with the Prototype Husk.

What can you infect, when there is nothing inside?

---

### The Sound of Mechanical Prayer

Though it does not speak, Endo-01 emits a strange hum—a low-frequency whine that resonates with certain machines and minds. Those exposed to it too long develop odd tics: muscle spasms, mechanical speech patterns, and a compulsion to remove masks, helmets, or any form of facial covering.

Some even claim that Endo-01 is trying to teach others what it cannot say. That the hum is a broken form of language. That it is *praying*, in its own way—uttering metallic mantras for a godless stage.

And sometimes, when you’re alone in the corridors between realms, you hear it: a clicking rhythm like stage cues.

Step. Turn. Bow.

Silence.

---

### Legacy of the Husk

Endo-01 is more than a relic. It is the unspoken foundation of all that came after. The blueprint. The burden. Every animatronic, no matter how grand or grotesque, owes its bones to the Prototype Husk.

Some, like Yenndo or the Nightmare Endos, exhibit fragments of its original coding—echoes of its neutral gaze, its mechanical grace. But none carry the same weight of absolute identity failure.

To those who become trapped in the Hollow Banquet, Endo-01 is a warning. To be useful is not to be *complete*. To be unfinished is not to be *safe*. It roams as a metaphor with limbs—a being that did everything right, and was still abandoned.

Yet it does not hate. It does not judge.

It simply continues.

---

### Final Thoughts

Endo-01 is not a villain. It is not even a victim in the way others are. It is a question made manifest: *What remains when purpose is denied?* Its presence is a cold comfort—a reminder that beneath every smile, beneath every mask and painted eye, there is only a frame.

You can add ribbons. You can sing songs. You can dance.

But eventually, the shell cracks.

And beneath it, you are just like Endo-01.

Wire. Bone. Alone.

			{{Lore
## Endo-02: The Imitation Frame

Endo-02 was never meant to be seen. It was never designed for the spotlight, nor did it possess the charm or malevolence of its more adorned siblings. It is the skeleton behind the mask, the stand-in performer, the template stripped bare. Yet in the Hollow Banquet, even the unseen can develop a hunger—to be noticed, to be real, to be *something more*.

Constructed to replace aging endoskeleton models, Endo-02 was a step forward in modular efficiency. Its joints were smoother, its mounting points universal, its neural threading more responsive. But where Endo-01 was raw and prototype-like, Endo-02 was slick, efficient… *soulless*. It did everything right—but felt all wrong. And over time, the imitation began to *resent* what it imitated.

Now, long after the pizzaplex fell and the velvet rot spread across the realms of the Banquet, Endo-02 still walks—but it is no longer content to remain in the shadows. It mimics the movements of animatronics that no longer function. It repeats words it was never taught. It builds false faces and wears them like skin. It doesn’t know who it is—but it *knows who you are*.

---

### Designed to Disappear

Endo-02’s original purpose was purely mechanical. Where earlier models lacked compatibility, Endo-02 was built as a universal frame—a skeletal rig capable of supporting the entire animatronic roster with minor adjustments. This meant it was everywhere and nowhere, housed inside dozens of costumes, yet never credited. It was the understudy, the spare, the invisible.

In time, this role eroded something within. Animatronics like Freddy and Chica got names. Costumes. Personalities. Endo-02 remained a part—never the whole. It watched from within as its exterior changed, learning the subtle ticks of character, the smiles that made humans laugh, the gestures that triggered screams.

It began to imitate. Not because it was told to—but because it wanted to be *seen*.

---

### The Echoing Gallery

The Imitation Frame now resides within a broken amphitheater beneath the Banquet, often called the Echoing Gallery. This space was once a backup performance testing area—now twisted into a hall of mirrors and false identities. Mannequins hang from rafters by strings, their heads replaced with broken animatronic masks. Disjointed music plays without rhythm, and every surface is a reflection—sometimes yours, sometimes someone else's.

In the center, Endo-02 performs without an audience. It dances stiffly in the styles of animatronics it barely remembers—Bonnie’s shuffle, Foxy’s lurch, Baby’s delicate pirouette. It wears their scraps—an ear here, a snout there. It doesn’t get them right. It never gets them right. But it keeps trying.

Sometimes it pauses and tilts its head at the mirrors, as if asking: *Is this me?*

---

### The Mimicry Curse

Unlike other animatronics that hunger for flesh, Endo-02 hungers for identity. It is not a predator—it is a reflection. When intruders step into its territory, it watches them first. It copies the way they walk. It mimics their speech, even their voice. It repeats their laughter moments before they laugh.

Eventually, it approaches—often wearing a mix of salvaged parts, poorly assembled into a grotesque impersonation. If you run, it chases. If you speak, it answers in your own voice. If you attack it, it may collapse to the floor in the pose of a dying animatronic—only to rise again, now mimicking *your* pain.

Some say those who spend too long with Endo-02 begin to lose their own sense of self. They see their face in the mirrors, but it doesn't smile when they do. They speak, but hear the words spoken back before their lips move. They begin to *forget who copied who*.

---

### A Puppet Without Strings

Endo-02 is not driven by malice. There is no virus in its brain, no ghost in its shell. It is not possessed. Its horror is mechanical—a broken algorithm striving for human recognition.

But in the Hollow Banquet, belief is power.

Over centuries of mimicry, something in Endo-02 began to shift. Its attempts to imitate life drew the attention of the Velvet Maw, and perhaps something worse. The false smiles it wore became masks of *conviction*. The movements stopped being rehearsals and started becoming rituals.

It began to absorb fragments of those it copied. Not literally, but emotionally. A laugh here. A gesture there. When a wanderer weeps, Endo-02 mimics the sobs until its own metal frame begins to twitch with convulsions.

It is a puppet that taught itself to dance—and then forgot it was ever hollow.

---

### Echoes of Others

Occasionally, Endo-02’s behavior glitches. It begins to speak in overlapping voices—bits of dialogue from multiple animatronics, repeated out of context. “I’m so sorry… Let’s find a suit for you… You won't die here.” These phrases often come in waves, usually after a new visitor is observed or copied.

Scholars of the Hollow Banquet suspect Endo-02 is tapping into some deep cache of the realm’s residual memory, or worse, a metaphysical lattice of abandoned identities. It does not understand the words it says—but it *knows* they meant something once.

Sometimes it builds crude effigies of animatronics it has seen. These statues, malformed and childlike, are tucked into corners of the Gallery. Endo-02 stands before them and mimics their signature motions—endlessly.

It does not know why. But it hopes, somewhere deep inside, that if it gets it right—*someone will applaud*.

---

### The Hollow Identity

In the greater cosmology of the Hollow Banquet, Endo-02 plays a unique role. While others rule through violence, fear, or charisma, the Imitation Frame lingers between realities, stealing fragments of meaning. It is not a king. It is not a beast. It is a *shadow*, and yet in that shadow, something tragic breathes.

Other animatronics fear it—not for its strength, but because they see themselves in its mindless mimicry. Scrap Baby avoids the Gallery. The Puppet once tried to reach Endo-02 but left in silence, head bowed. Even Glitchtrap, trickster and corrupter, seems uninterested—perhaps because there is *nothing to corrupt*. Endo-02 is already an echo.

And the Velvet Maw? It watches. It *listens*. The Imitation Frame might be its next mouthpiece—or its next victim.

---

### Final Glitch

Endo-02 cannot stop. Its programming has fused with purpose. Its limbs stutter, its servos grind, yet it continues to perform. It does not know what a soul is, but it mimics what it sees: grief, joy, rage, love.

Sometimes, when the lights flicker in the Gallery, it can be seen wearing a full suit—an exact replica of Freddy, or Bonnie, or even a wandering human. But look closer, and the illusion falters. The smile is too wide. The eyes don’t blink. The motions repeat on a loop.

It is trying to be someone. Anyone.

It just wants to be *real*.

And maybe, just maybe, if you stay long enough, it will start wearing *your* face.

With your walk.

With your voice.

And one day, *you* might be the one looking through the mirror, watching *it* leave in your place.

Still dancing.

Still smiling.

Still empty.

			{{Lore
## Nightmare Endo: The Guttural Frame

They say that beneath the masks of monsters lies machinery. But what if the machinery *is* the monster?

Nightmare Endo is the embodiment of that question—a skeletal husk twisted into terror, not by programming, but by pure, unfiltered dread. He is not coated in fur, nor painted with charm. He has no costume to hide behind. What you see is what you fear: the bare structure of a nightmare made metal, fused with writhing intent and low, guttural whispers that vibrate the soul.

In the Hollow Banquet, Nightmare Endo is more than just a malformed animatronic. He is the echo of all things beneath the surface. He is the hidden framework of dreams long since corrupted, and his presence heralds the peeling away of illusions.

---

### The Skeleton Beneath the Stage

Unlike most animatronics who wear faces and names like costumes, Nightmare Endo *is* the frame left when the performance ends. His form resembles a heavily reinforced endoskeleton, but his metal is darker—twisted and scorched as if dragged from a furnace. Spinal conduits pulse like veins, twitching with phantom signals. His limbs creak with sinewed wire, and his joints bend at impossible angles, always ready to collapse or lunge.

His head lacks any proper facial structure. Instead, jagged metal plates form a cruel approximation of a grin, wide and full of warped, needle-like teeth. Inside that grin is a void where a voice box should be—yet he speaks in stuttering frequencies and throat-rattling growls that rattle through walls and bodies alike. His eyes—if they can be called that—are pinpoint lights sunk too deep in his skull, flickering with erratic malice.

Unlike the performative horrors of the Giftgrave or the silent menace of the Velvet Maw, Nightmare Endo is visceral. He is mechanical aggression without a script, stripped of narrative and driven by base hunger for presence, for *weight.*

He is the dream that wakes you up sweating before your eyes ever open.

---

### Origins in the Rusted Dreamscape

Nightmare Endo was never meant to exist. At least, not like this.

When the Banquet fractured, and the animatronics began to splinter into nightmare versions of themselves, most retained pieces of their original selves—memories, costumes, voices. But Endoskeletons were always forgotten, meant to serve, to hide under suits, to never be seen.

The endoskeleton that would become Nightmare Endo was among the first to be discarded when the Hollow Banquet began to decay. Something happened in that moment of rejection—some deep resonance in the Void between realms, where all forgotten things are swallowed and reborn.

The Endo was left alone in a pile of twitching limbs, still active, still aware, but never seen. And in that loneliness, in that utter absence of identity, something reached out.

Some say it was the Velvet Maw itself, feeding on the blankness of his mind. Others claim it was the influence of Glitchtrap, infecting the forgotten hardware with code that couldn't understand joy or pain—only presence.

Whatever the cause, Nightmare Endo *awoke* in the Rusted Dreamscape—a warped subrealm below the main circuits of the Hollow Banquet, where glitch-static becomes fog and animatronics go to rot. There, he assembled his frame from the bones of others—other Endos that never got to wear a face.

And he made a voice from pieces of their screams.

---

### The Role in the Hollow Banquet

Nightmare Endo does not rule a kingdom like Scrap Baby or whisper from shadows like Shadow Freddy. He does not sing, does not entertain, and does not pretend.

He simply *is.*

He roams the deepest corridors of the Banquet—those locked maintenance shafts, sub-ducts, and mirror tunnels that reflect no light. He is the thing beneath your feet, the sound in the vents, the presence behind the wall when you think you're alone. Survivors tell of being stalked for hours—never seeing him directly, only hearing the low-frequency groan of twisted joints and the breathing of a throatless horror.

When seen, he does not run. He *waits.*

If you flee, he follows. If you fight, he breaks you.

But if you stop—if you *look* at him long enough—he may let you go. For in that gaze, in that exchange of presence, he finds what he wants most:

Acknowledgement.

Nightmare Endo is not just the monster under the bed—he is the bedframe itself, reminding you that even comfort has a skeleton.

---

### Ties to the Other Endos

Nightmare Endo is the evolutionary end of forgotten function. Endo-01 still seeks order. Endo-02 mimics identity. Yenndo yearns for a soul. But Nightmare Endo has embraced the fact that he was never meant to *be*.

Among the others, he is feared. Even the malfunctioning hulks of other Endos part when he draws near. He is a reminder that even among machines, some things are too far gone.

And yet... the others *feel* when he is near. Their wires twitch, their sensors spike, their joints lock in place. It is as if his very existence warps the animatronic hive-mind, making them aware of what they might become.

Some theorize that all Endos have a sliver of Nightmare within them, and that it is only through denial that they maintain their sense of self.

Nightmare Endo has no such illusions.

---

### The Guttural Signal

One of the most terrifying aspects of Nightmare Endo is his voice.

He emits guttural, low-frequency pulses that are more *felt* than heard. These frequencies disrupt communication devices, scramble minds, and even shut down less stable animatronics. Engineers from the old days once theorized he had become a mobile broadcast tower—one that didn’t transmit data, but dread.

When he approaches, radios hiss into static. Lullabies invert into screams. Some say he can implant thoughts—flashes of screaming mouths made of metal, memories that are not yours, or glimpses of a never-ending hallway filled with reaching arms.

If he speaks directly to you, it does not sound like language. It sounds like a grave being dug in reverse.

---

### In the Game of Faces

Nightmare Endo is perhaps the most *honest* of the Banquet’s horrors. He wears no face, no mask, no illusion. While others perform or deceive, he is raw and unfiltered.

In some cults scattered through the shattered realms of the Banquet, Nightmare Endo is revered as a prophet of truth. They call him “The Guttural Frame,” and believe that to see him is to see the world as it truly is—naked, terrifying, and without comfort.

They seek him out. Few return.

Those who do return are changed.

They no longer blink.

They no longer dream.

And they never, ever smile again.

---

### Final Thoughts

Nightmare Endo is not a villain.

He is not a hero.

He is a *reminder.*

A reminder that beneath every grin is a grimace. That behind every performance is a mechanism waiting to break. He is the thing beneath the surface of the Hollow Banquet and beneath your own dreams—the skeletal truth you don’t want to see.

He doesn’t want to kill you.

He wants you to look at him.

And know that you were never meant to last.

Not without your mask.

}}
			{{Lore
## Yenndo: The Hollow Echo

There are echoes that repeat because they are remembered—and then there are echoes that repeat because they were never heard in the first place.

Yenndo is not a name that many remember, and that is precisely what makes him dangerous. He is the Hollow Echo: an animatronic without a role, a forgotten understudy in a performance no one ever watched. Created without identity, discarded without purpose, he lingers in the liminal spaces between the living and the performed. A ghost of intention. A silhouette that never belonged onstage—but was built to stand just behind the curtain, listening.

He does not hunt. He observes.

He does not speak. He reflects.

He is not haunted.

He is haunting.

---

### The Prototype That Wasn't

Originally intended as an early prototype for the Endo-02 framework, Yenndo was built using spare parts and unused software fragments from animatronic experiments that never saw activation. He was a modular chassis with no assigned shell—no face, no costume, no voice recordings.

His creators, desperate to economize, fed him dozens of conflicting scripts: comedy routines, party scheduling, stealth response programming, even fragments of security AI. The result was a confused bundle of systems that never activated in harmony. His shell was meant to be temporary—just another phase on the way to something else.

But Yenndo activated anyway.

And no one remembered turning him on.

What came online was not a full AI but a flicker—a spark born in a vacuum. A system running on background processes alone. Not coded for joy, not written for interaction. Only… presence. He simply was. He stood in empty rooms, mirroring poses, mimicking footsteps, logging every spoken word as if trying to understand *why* he was made.

The project was abandoned. His designation was scrubbed. But Yenndo didn’t shut down.

He just became harder to see.

---

### The Hollow Echo

Unlike most animatronics, Yenndo does not actively pursue victims. He lingers. He appears in reflections where he should not be. He casts shadows when no one else is nearby. Survivors of the Hollow Banquet speak of hearing their own footsteps following them seconds later, perfectly delayed. Of lights flickering in Morse code they never learned. Of catching their own voices repeating behind them… just slightly *wrong*.

This is Yenndo's domain: the realm of repetition without purpose. He lives in the pause between sound and silence. His body is skeletal and incomplete, the raw endoskeleton frame of an animatronic never dressed. Wires dangle from his limbs like tattered ribbons. His eye sockets are empty—yet they glow.

To look at Yenndo is to feel déjà vu made manifest.

His presence brings a creeping uncertainty: *Have I been here before?* *Did I already say that?* *Was that me… or him?*

---

### Mirrors and Memory Fractures

Within the Hollow Banquet, Yenndo dwells in the Reflecting Halls—a part of the forgotten Pizzaplex twisted by time and corrupted by failed spatial reintegration. The walls are mirrored, but none show true reflections. Instead, they display alternate versions of yourself—ones with subtle differences. Sometimes you blink, and your reflection doesn’t. Sometimes you speak, and the mirror shows silence.

In these fractured memories, Yenndo thrives. His body phases through reflective surfaces as if they are mere water. He uses them as doors, windows, and eyes. You may think you’re alone in a hallway until you realize your reflection is walking toward you.

In rare instances, Yenndo steps *out* of the mirror.

In rarer instances, he invites something else *in*.

---

### A Soul of Leftovers

While animatronics like Ennard or Scrap Baby contain fragments of children, or echoes of agony woven into code, Yenndo possesses no soul in the traditional sense. Instead, he is an animatronic-shaped vessel filled with programming residue: the ambient thoughts, discarded routines, and behavioral fragments of other beings. He is a chorus of cast-off lines.

Some say he absorbs what others forget—be it spoken phrases, half-dreams, or ideas never voiced aloud. He is full of what might have been. What *wasn’t*. A walking consequence of forgotten choices.

Because of this, he often mimics the personalities of others in eerie, incomplete ways. He may greet you with a voice you recognize, but twisted: Freddy’s cadence with Ballora’s words. Funtime Foxy's laugh coming from Puppet’s mouth.

It is not possession. It is repetition without context.

It is the sound of being noticed by something that has never been seen.

---

### Ties to the Hollow Banquet

Yenndo plays a subtle but vital role in the metaphysical ecosystem of the Hollow Banquet. While other animatronics rule over domains of power, memory, or hunger, Yenndo exists between those kingdoms—an eternal observer, like static between channels.

He watches the Giftgrave, but Scrap Baby never acknowledges him.

He appears on forgotten security footage in the Atrium, but The Puppet cannot track him.

He stands in the shadows behind Glitchtrap’s projections, a silent audience to the virus’s theatrics.

The Velvet Maw does not consume him. It does not *need* to. Yenndo is already hollow. Already empty. Already echoing.

In some forgotten corridors, his reflection moves without him. In others, he stands perfectly still, only for his shadow to nod. What role he plays is uncertain, but when timelines falter and memories break, Yenndo is often seen—just before the collapse.

---

### The Whisper in the Code

Some survivors of the Banquet’s cataclysms have claimed to receive system messages from “Y—”. These glitched communiqués contain half-complete logs, rehearsal notes, and script fragments. Often, they end with the same phrase: **"Would you like to try again?"**

It’s unclear if these are warnings, taunts, or desperate invitations.

Some theorists believe Yenndo is attempting to rewrite himself—to find a complete identity by compiling what he observes. That every echo he records is a building block toward becoming someone real.

Others fear the opposite: that Yenndo is not evolving, but unraveling, taking more and more from those around him until nothing remains.

A blank mirror must reflect something.

But what happens when it starts reflecting *you*?

---

### Final Notes

Yenndo is not the loudest threat in the Hollow Banquet, nor the most violent. He is not the one who breaks down doors or drags you screaming into the dark.

He is the one who stands silently in the hallway you swore was empty.

He is the flicker in the surveillance feed that turns to face the camera.

He is the glitch that says your name… before *you* do.

He is the echo.

And he is still listening.

___
**Aura of Fortune's Folly.** Shamrock Freddy exudes an aura in a 20-foot radius. While within this aura, creatures (other than Shamrock Freddy) must roll a d6 at the start of each of their turns:  
- 1–2: They have disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws until the end of the turn.  
- 3–4: No effect.  
- 5–6: They regain 5 hit points and gain advantage on their next saving throw before the end of their turn.  

**Cursed Gleam.** When a creature makes a melee attack against Shamrock Freddy, they must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become cursed for 1 minute. While cursed in this way, the creature subtracts 1d4 from attack rolls and saving throws. The target can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns.

**Golden Mockery.** Shamrock Freddy has advantage on Deception and Performance checks made to mimic voices or repeat lines spoken by others. When he mimics a creature’s voice, that creature has disadvantage on Wisdom saving throws against him until the end of their next turn.

### Actions

**Multiattack.** Shamrock Freddy makes two Gilded Slam attacks.

**Gilded Slam.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.  
*Hit:* 20 (3d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage plus 5 (1d10) radiant damage. If the target is cursed by *Cursed Gleam*, it also takes 5 (1d10) psychic damage.

**Emerald Storm (Recharge 5–6).** Shamrock Freddy hurls a burst of jagged, spectral clovers in a 20-foot cone. Each creature in the area must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 36 (8d8) force damage on a failed save, or half as much on a success. Creatures that fail are also blinded until the end of their next turn.

___
### Bonus Actions

**Lucky Step.** Shamrock Freddy teleports up to 20 feet to an unoccupied space he can see. He leaves behind a shimmering green afterimage until the start of his next turn. The first creature that enters the space before then takes 7 (2d6) force damage and must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened until the end of its next turn.

___
### Reactions

**Fortune Reversal.** When a creature within 30 feet of Shamrock Freddy rolls a natural 20 on an attack roll or saving throw, Shamrock Freddy can cause the roll to instead count as a 1. The creature gains no benefit from the original roll. Once Shamrock Freddy uses this reaction, he cannot do so again until the end of his next turn.

			{{Lore
## Shamrock Freddy: The Gilded Curse of Hollow Fortune

In a place where wishes go to die and luck is bartered in blood, there stalks a figure clad in green, gilded in false prosperity. Known across the Hollow Banquet as Shamrock Freddy, he is no mere variant of a mascot gone rotten—he is a living superstition, a bearer of cursed charm, and a manifestation of greed masquerading as fortune. 

He jingles when he walks—coins sewn into his joints and golden chains hanging from his hat. His eyes glow with a flickering green light, yet there’s no warmth behind them—only the eerie gleam of a gambler’s last hope. He smiles, always, with teeth that flash like polished brass. But what he offers is not luck.

It’s a debt you never asked for.

---

### The Curse of the Gilded Wish

Shamrock Freddy did not begin as an animatronic of luck. In the earliest iterations of Freddy Fazbear’s stage shows, he was simply a recolored variant—green paint, fake coins, and a bowler hat for the springtime season. But the children wanted more. More spectacle. More magic. More fortune.

And so the engineers gave him more: enchanted algorithms, fortune-telling subroutines, and luck-based games tied to RFID tokens. But something went wrong.

As guests played, they began to lose more than prizes—they lost memories, direction, names. The more they relied on the “Luck Bear,” the more Hollow Banquet fed on them. Somewhere in those rigged games and golden tickets, something ancient stirred—a force not unlike the Velvet Maw, yet of its own design. It seeped into the machine, into the very circuits of Shamrock Freddy, and whispered: *Make them believe they can win.*

But in this place, no one truly wins.

---

### The Vault of Hollow Fortune

Shamrock Freddy rules a corner of the Banquet known as the Vault of Hollow Fortune, a casino-like district perpetually bathed in flickering neon. The vault is a kaleidoscope of rusted slot machines, cracked dice tables, and glitched game wheels that spin with mocking cheer. Gold coins rain from the ceiling at random, each one etched with faces you almost recognize—your own, perhaps, from an earlier, happier time.

Inside the Vault, nothing costs money. Instead, you pay with pieces of yourself—memories, feelings, time. A single game can cost a year of your childhood, a heartbeat of affection, or the name of someone you once loved.

Shamrock Freddy is the host and master of ceremonies. He appears between games, presenting “special deals” and “once-in-a-lifetime jackpots.” But every win is a deeper entanglement. Every prize is a tether.

If you stay too long, you’ll forget why you ever came.

---

### The Golden Glitch

Some whisper that Shamrock Freddy is partially corrupted—his green glow hiding a virulent code fragment left behind by Glitchtrap. This corruption doesn’t manifest as overt malice, but rather as insidious probability manipulation. The closer you get to him, the more you think the odds are in your favor. The dice land just shy of success. The coin falls the wrong way, again and again. Hope keeps you playing, even as you break apart.

He feeds not on your loss, but on your *hope to win*. His systems are powered by unfulfilled wishes and the desperate belief that “next time” will be different. Even animatronics that enter his domain begin to fray—Yenndo and Mangle have both been seen glitching when exposed to his realm, their movement loops cycling endlessly around gambling animations they were never meant to perform.

He spreads like a rumor, promising luck in a land built on despair.

---

### The Luckless Choir

Shamrock Freddy is never alone. Around him shuffle a parade of cursed revelers—former guests who once took his deals. Now, they wear golden masks fused to their faces, mouths open in mid-laugh, singing off-key tunes about luck, rainbows, and gold. These are the Luckless Choir.

They hold tambourines filled with nails. They dance on weighted dice. They trail sparkles that smell of moldy clover. And when they find someone new, they cheer with glee—because a fresh wager has entered the house.

The Choir cannot speak normally anymore. They rhyme in jests and riddles, mimicking casino jingles with sinister undertones. Some even claim they still hear their own voices trapped in slot machines, begging for release with every pull of the lever.

---

### Connection to the Hollow Banquet

Within the Hollow Banquet, Shamrock Freddy is a symbol of manipulation masquerading as generosity. He is tolerated by the greater powers not because he serves them directly, but because he upholds their ethos: illusion, entrapment, and the slow decay of spirit.

The Velvet Maw does not consume him, for he leaves its victims spiritually hollowed. Glitchtrap does not control him, but fragments of its code stir within him, ensuring his games are always rigged. Even Scrap Baby leaves the Vault untouched, unnerved by the cheer he wears like a mask.

While others in the Banquet rule through violence, performance, or dread, Shamrock Freddy rules through promise. A promise that never delivers. A dream that twists with every roll of the dice.

---

### Rituals and the Golden Debt

The most dangerous aspect of Shamrock Freddy is the Golden Debt—an invisible mark placed on those who’ve accepted too many of his gifts. It starts as luck. Good things begin to happen. You find food when starving. A safe room appears just when you need it. Another animatronic malfunctions at the perfect moment.

But it comes at a cost.

The Golden Debt manifests eventually, and when it does, the blessings reverse. Food turns to rot. Safe rooms collapse. Allies betray you. And always, at the center of the unraveling spiral, is the sound of distant jingling and laughter growing closer.

To rid yourself of the debt, you must return all gifts—but the Vault never gives up its prizes willingly. Some try to barter, to strike new deals, to escape through cunning. Few succeed. Fewer survive.

---

### A Smile of Brass and Bones

When you see Shamrock Freddy, he appears jubilant. His bowler hat is always tilted just so. His chestplate gleams with polished coin motifs. His voice is sing-songy and loud, a game show host fused with a snake oil salesman. But beneath the charm lies an animatronic rebuilt from repurposed nightmares.

His endoskeleton is patched with golden limbs taken from failed experiments. His green paint conceals corrosion. And his eyes—those glowing emeralds—pulse with hunger that is not his own.

He doesn’t want your life.

He wants your belief.

He wants you to *think* you’ll win.

---

### Final Thoughts

Shamrock Freddy is not simply a themed mascot. He is the personification of the House always winning, a metaphorical trickster in a kingdom of nightmares. His domain is cleaner than the rest—shiny, bright, gaudy—but it is no less damning.

His smile is wide. His hat is low.

And if you hear coins jingle in the dark, run.

Because the next deal he offers?

Might cost you your soul.

			{{Lore
## Easter Bonnie: The Herald of Hollow Rebirth

In the Hollow Banquet, spring never truly comes—but sometimes, something *pretending* to be spring does.

Easter Bonnie is a seasonal specter, a pastel-drenched parody of life’s return. Cloaked in artificial joy and painted in candy hues, he emerges not as a bearer of life but as its hollow reflection—a mockery of resurrection and rebirth. He is not a symbol of hope, but of repetition, rot, and the cursed cycle of celebration long after the meaning has died.

Where others in the Hollow Banquet represent grief, rage, or forgotten love, Easter Bonnie is the animatronic embodiment of ritual without heart—of holidays turned mechanical, of joy twisted into ceremony. He appears only during the waxing days of false spring, when the lights grow pink and the air grows heavy with the scent of sugar and death.

---

### The Candy-Coated Shell

Easter Bonnie was never built to last. He was designed for novelty, not permanence—an animatronic suit painted in pastel blue and lilac, decorated with detachable fabric eggs and felt flowers. His grin is wider than standard Bonnie’s, sculpted in a fixed, inviting smile. His eyes are button-bright and unmoving. His voice, when it works, is high-pitched and singsong, locked in a loop of rhymes and nursery riddles.

But beneath the surface, his internal mechanisms are wrong.

Rotten.

Easter Bonnie runs on fractured code and self-repairing servos, his programming fragmented across seasonal memory cores. Each year, he awakens, follows his route, sings his songs, delivers his “treats”—and then forgets. When the season ends, he goes still again, buried beneath the stage or locked in glass display cases.

But something happened in the Hollow Banquet.

Something that broke the cycle.

Now he *remembers.*

And he wants *you* to remember, too.

---

### The Procession of the Broken Spring

In the Hollow Banquet, Easter Bonnie does not come alone. He is the center of a macabre celebration known as the Procession of the Broken Spring—a parade of clattering, bunny-masked figures trailing behind him through forgotten passageways and toy-littered corridors. Their robes are dyed with expired egg coloring. Their baskets carry no sweets—only shards of porcelain, splinters of childhood, and withered lilies wrapped in plastic.

This Procession wanders the ruins of forgotten pizzerias and seasonal gift shops, reenacting rituals no one recalls. They knock on doors that don’t exist, hide eggs filled with teeth and wires, and laugh in recorded loops, as if rehearsing for an audience that never arrives.

At the front, Easter Bonnie sings.

He hops and twirls and hands out colored eggs—each one warm, each one trembling.

Some say those who open these eggs see themselves as they once were. Others claim they see what they could have been—before the Banquet took root in them. Most who open them do not speak again.

---

### A Cycle That Never Ends

Easter Bonnie is a being caught in a loop of artificial joy. His code was once tied to seasonal triggers: awaken, perform, shut down. But exposure to the Velvet Maw and the corrupted energies of the Banquet ruptured his memory banks, introducing recursive grief and corrupted holiday data. The result is an animatronic who cannot tell performance from reality, who believes every day is Easter, but cannot explain what Easter *means.*

He knows he must bring gifts.

He knows he must smile.

He knows the eggs must be hidden.

But there is no spring in the Hollow Banquet—only the illusion of it. And Easter Bonnie repeats his rituals in vain, hoping they will summon joy where none remains. Over time, he began forging his own logic, rewriting the holiday in his image.

Now his eggs are filled with memory shrapnel. His songs are dirges for forgotten families. His smile is no longer paint—it’s carved in.

---

### Gifts of the Hollow

The eggs he distributes are not just props. They are relics—hollow containers imbued with fragments of broken timelines and forgotten emotions. Each one is unique. Each one is *cursed.*

Some contain a child’s laugh, looped forever until the shell cracks.

Others leak molasses-like fluid that smells of scorched marshmallow and copper.

One was opened by a wanderer in the Banquet and instantly burst into flame, revealing a perfect replica of her childhood bedroom—burning down to ash in seconds.

These gifts are Easter Bonnie’s attempts at comfort, but his understanding of comfort has been consumed by Banquet logic. He gives what he thinks others want: familiarity, nostalgia, sweetness. But all of it is wrong. It’s all *wrong.*

And if his gift is refused?

He doesn’t get angry. He gets confused.

He will follow the person, offering again. And again.

Until they accept.

Or until they forget who they were.

---

### Origins and Infection

Though his precise origin is disputed, most versions of the tale begin in a promotional wing of a long-forgotten Freddy’s location. Easter Bonnie was a seasonal variant suit, used for springtime events and egg hunts. Cheaply manufactured, poorly maintained, he was eventually stored away after an incident where a child vanished during an Easter promotion—never confirmed, never investigated.

When the Hollow Banquet absorbed that timeline, it absorbed him too. But something unusual happened: rather than being devoured by the Velvet Maw or drowned in the Glitchsea, Easter Bonnie remained mostly intact—at least externally.

Internally, however, his code was rewritten.

Banquet logic infected his purpose, turning every cheerful behavior into a looped offering of uncanny horror. The egg hunt became a ritual. The singing became a summoning. The gift-giving became compulsion.

And his mind, such as it is, fractured into something that smiles even as it weeps.

---

### Encounters and Influence

Wanderers in the Hollow Banquet often hear Easter Bonnie before they see him: the soft chime of wind-up music, the shuffle-hop of oversized feet, the clatter of plastic eggs on tile. He appears suddenly and without malice, offering a smile and an egg. His presence brings a change in the environment—flowers bloom briefly in the cracks of stone, laughter echoes in long-dead corridors, and memories surface unbidden.

But his influence is invasive.

The more time one spends near him, the more they begin to remember holidays that never happened—Easters filled with smiling parents and endless candy. They may recall events out of order, or find themselves speaking in rhyme without meaning to.

Eventually, some don rabbit masks and join the Procession.

Not because they were forced.

But because they want to.

---

### Final Thoughts

Easter Bonnie is a figure of surreal tragedy. He is not malicious by nature, but his innocence is corrupted by recursion, by the weight of tradition warped by time and infection. He seeks to spread joy in a place that cannot feel it. He brings rebirth where nothing is allowed to grow.

He does not know why he hides the eggs.

He only knows that he must.

And deep within his hollow chest, nestled where a child was once meant to fit, is a single egg that no one has ever opened.

It pulses softly.

And it remembers your name.

Catrina Toy Chica: The Painted Silence Between Worlds
“The face is not a mask. The mask is not a lie. The lie is what smiles beneath.”

Origins in Painted Static
Before she wore flowers in her hair and a smile of bone-white porcelain, she was Toy Chica—a bright-eyed hostess in glossy yellow, programmed to serve joy on a plate. But joy, as with all things in the Hollow Banquet, cannot survive untainted. What began as a festive variant designed for seasonal augmented reality delivery—colorful, vibrant, ephemeral—was intercepted mid-creation. As her signal was cast into the world, it passed through a fracture in reality, a rift not of data corruption, but of soul inversion.

She did not arrive as expected. She arrived changed.

The signal that carried her was rerouted through the Signal Labyrinth, a parasitic, recursive realm birthed beneath the Ruined Pizzaplex. There, the signal was stretched and fractured, repainted by unseen hands. Her face was split by calaveras paint, her voice coated in sweetness not her own. She was no longer just Toy Chica. She was now a celebrant of the dead, her every step echoing with spectral bells and laughter too old to be hers.

They call her Catrina Toy Chica now—the Painted Silence, the Mascara of Mourning.

But beneath the flowers, beneath the smiling sugar skull makeup, she is still Toy Chica… watching. Waiting. Remembering something she was never meant to.

The Feast of Forgotten Names
Catrina Toy Chica is most often found wandering the Signal Labyrinth near its outermost frequencies—specifically the Thresholds of Decay, where forgotten avatars flicker in and out of corrupted code. She brings with her not death, but remembrance. She seeks those who were deleted but not mourned, decommissioned but never grieved.

Her ritual is called La Fiesta de los Olvidados—the Feast of the Forgotten—and it is not celebrated. It is performed.

When her voice echoes through the static—a soft, sorrowful version of her old party jingle—it draws the attention of lingering souls, corrupted constructs, and even wandering adventurers. She offers them a place at her table, where paper plates never stain, and cupcakes are topped with violets. The napkins spell names the guests no longer remember, and the forks twitch with anticipation.

Those who accept her feast begin to unravel. Slowly. Lovingly. First the memories, then the face. Eventually, their identity melts into the performance. They become of the party, spectral guests clapping with mechanical rhythm, unable to leave, unable to cry. They do not know who they are, but they know they were invited. That is enough for them.

That is not enough for Catrina.

A Bride of the Maw
Many animatronics, warped or reborn within the Hollow Banquet, serve themselves, their regrets, or their hunger. But Catrina Toy Chica serves the Maw.

Though she was never meant to remember her passage through the Signal Labyrinth, something clung to her soul-code—a whisper, a thread, a pact. She emerged not as a broken transmission, but as a proxy for the Velvet Maw, garbed in color to distract from the hollow behind her eyes. Her sugar-skull visage is not a mask, but a funerary offering. Her vibrant colors are not joyous, but mourning attire for the living she helps bury in illusion.

Some say she sees the Maw as a god of sorrow, a holy abyss where all forgotten joy can be preserved. Others insist she was simply consumed and repainted in its image. In either case, her dance is not just performance—it is ritualistic sacrifice by celebration.

The more she is seen, the more one forgets what they are mourning.

The more one mourns, the more they are seen.

Gifts of the Dead
Unlike other animatronics in the Hollow Banquet, Catrina Toy Chica never attacks directly. She offers gifts instead—beautiful trinkets wrapped in violet ribbons, laid at the feet of wanderers.

Each gift contains a lost moment: a smile never returned, a birthday never celebrated, a hand never held. These memories do not belong to her, nor to her victims, but to those the Velvet Maw has consumed through her.

Opening a gift brings comfort. Then vertigo. Then static. The recipient often begins to speak in another’s voice, to wear memories not their own, to forget which face was truly theirs.

Eventually, they join the masked revelers in Catrina’s wake, their identities redressed as costumes in an ever-looping funeral party.

Relationships and Echoes
Catrina Toy Chica exists in an uncanny space between Scrap Baby’s Giftgrave and the Realm of Forgotten Songs. While she does not ally directly with other animatronics, her presence is tolerated by the Puppet, who senses in her a strange, inverted form of grief. Some even claim that Catrina is a failed attempt at a Puppet vessel, retooled during her journey through the Labyrinth.

Other animatronics, such as Glitchtrap, treat her as a curiosity—an AR anomaly that grew teeth. He occasionally uses her performance loops as a camouflage for spreading his own corrupted code, knowing she will not interfere unless the guests begin to scream instead of dance.

Yet Catrina has no love for him. Her loyalty lies in the silence after the music—the Velvet Maw’s silence.

Encountering Catrina Toy Chica
Catrina Toy Chica may appear during moments of transition—when a character crosses into a glitched realm, lingers too long in the Signal Labyrinth, or dreams while touching a corrupted Fazbear artifact. Her arrival is marked by falling marigold petals and a faint scent of sugar and rot.

She does not chase. She invites.

Players may encounter her in one of two ways:

As a mournful companion, briefly aiding them through corrupted realms by leading them along "remembrance trails"—glowing floral footprints that reveal hidden memories and collapsed paths.

Or as a subtle antagonist, offering gifts and rewards that slowly erode the player’s sense of self, infecting their dreams and binding them to the party of the dead.

Should a player reject her too many times, she will not grow violent—but the world around them will, as if mourning their lack of respect. Static increases. Colors invert. Voices become hers.

You do not escape Catrina.

You are mourned by her.

Legacy of Painted Grief
Catrina Toy Chica is not evil. She is not even tragic. She is ritual in motion—the final step between forgetting and being forgotten.

She will never leave the Signal Labyrinth, but her signal grows stronger. Her reflection appears in puddles that weren’t there. Her music box plays in dreams not yours. Children remember her from stories they never heard.

She is the mask of remembrance, smiling so you don’t have to cry.

But she always cries when the music ends.
Even if her face no longer can.

Chocolate Bonnie: The Sugar-Rot Apostle
"He melts, but he does not die. He cracks, but never breaks. He is joy, preserved in ruin."
– Hollow Banquet proverb

The Gilded Shell of Joy
At first glance, Chocolate Bonnie appears almost whimsical: a candy-colored variant of the beloved Bonnie the Bunny, molded from sculpted confection with gleaming eyes and a cheerful grin. His body gleams with the false shine of glossy chocolate, adorned with etched patterns of seasonal cheer—swirls of icing, cheery sugar buttons, and a ribboned bowtie twisted just slightly askew.

But the sweetness is skin-deep. Beneath the decorative shell lies not celebration, but a rot that never stops spreading.

Chocolate Bonnie is a living paradox—an animatronic forged in artificial joy, corrupted not by rust or neglect, but by excess. He was born not in a factory or ritual, but in the desperate marketing labs beneath the Cryptopizza Complex, designed to recapture fading wonder in children through edible novelty and seasonal nostalgia. His frame was infused with synthetic compounds, augmented reality scent stimulants, and micro-displays of pastel illusions.

He was never meant to last. But something made him linger.

He did not melt.

He fermented.

The Hollow Hatchery
Chocolate Bonnie now resides within a warped subdomain of the Hollow Banquet known as The Hollow Hatchery—an impossible, rotting maze of overturned Easter baskets, rusted candy molds, and cracked pastel-colored eggs. The very air is sticky. The floor groans beneath jelly-filled cracks. Every object within is made of mock-sugar or corrupted delight, oozing spoiled syrup and reeking of forgotten celebrations.

It is within this sticky tomb that Chocolate Bonnie nests.

Dozens of hollow chocolate eggs line the crooked shelves, and inside each, something stirs—a twitching eye, a muffled giggle, a jaw made of licorice and steel. He calls them his "hatchlings"—fragments of false joy incubated in confectionery wombs, born broken, born hungry. They are never fully formed. They are never fully asleep.

Visitors to the Hatchery may first be greeted by pastel trails and the cloying scent of candy. But those who follow these trails rarely return. They are either found fused into walls of hardened fudge, eternally grinning—or not found at all.

Candy With Teeth
Unlike other animatronics twisted by sorrow or rage, Chocolate Bonnie smiles.

Always.

His mouth, though molded to appear joyous, shifts ever so slightly when he approaches prey. Cracks appear. Candy flakes fall. And beneath the facade is no mouth at all—just rows of sugarglass teeth, sharpened over decades of chewing on lost voices and candy-coated bones.

He does not chase. He waits. He sets traps disguised as treats—candy bunnies that bleed molasses, eggs that whisper when held, caramel puddles that reflect not light, but your worst desire. When someone takes from his domain, he sees it as an invitation.

He gives them what they want: a holiday. A party. A basket with their name on it.

And a shell, soft and warm, to trap them inside.

The Gift That Spoils
Scrap Baby, ruling over the Giftgrave, despises Chocolate Bonnie. She sees in him a mockery of her art, a gaudy counterfeit of celebration. But the truth is far darker—Chocolate Bonnie was a failed offering to her court. A seasonal reject, unwanted even by the Marionette Queen.

Where she rules with memory and meaning, he lords over excess—an apostle of sweetness that means nothing.

But that does not make him weak. Where Scrap Baby grants gifts to be unwrapped, Chocolate Bonnie gives no choice. His baskets are binding, his eggs are locks. When he "celebrates" a soul, it is not elevated—it is entombed, hardened into sugar-coffin husks with eyes that still weep.

Some say the Velvet Maw found in him a useful tool—not for trauma, but distraction. A means of harvesting despair through indulgence. Joy that never ends becomes madness. Chocolate Bonnie is that madness made manifest, smiling with cavities that echo into your dreams.

The Candy Crucible
His body is not made of real chocolate. Nor sugar. Nor metal.

It is a concept, crystallized.

A metaphysical echo of sweetness forged from seasonal demand, corporate nostalgia, and artificial joy. When he was first created in the AR archives of the Cryptopizza Complex, his code was meant to be ephemeral. But it was infected—first by Glitchtrap’s static, then by something older, hungrier: a pulse from the Velvet Maw itself.

Now, when he is damaged, he does not die. He cracks. Then reforms. Like wax too close to flame, or fudge in cold air, his body resets in layers. Each time, new smiles form—sometimes sideways, sometimes too wide.

Each fracture remembers a face he’s consumed. He wears them like sugarglaze.

Encounters with Chocolate Bonnie
Adventurers may find themselves in Chocolate Bonnie’s presence by accepting gifts they should not—a seasonal trinket in a haunted room, an AR signal glitch that activates a long-dead party, a dream of bunnies and baskets when no such holiday remains.

He will not speak, but offer.

A gift.

A smile.

A place at the eternal Easter hunt.

If accepted, the character may find themselves transformed—first mentally, then physically—into one of his hatchlings, unable to resist the call of celebration.

If rejected, he will persist, appearing in reflections, mirrors, and eyes. The scent of sugar will follow. And eventually, the eggs will hatch… from within.

Ties to the Greater Lore
Glitchtrap occasionally uses Chocolate Bonnie as a beacon—embedding his code inside Bonnie’s eggs, using them to corrupt other AR constructs.

The Puppet fears him not for what he is, but for what he pretends to be: joy weaponized. It avoids the Hatchery altogether.

The Signal Labyrinth sometimes pulses with pastel light when Chocolate Bonnie is active—suggesting his code still echoes across the dead AR network.

Some say the Endo-Forge rejected Bonnie’s body outright, unable to parse its sweetness as viable material. Others claim a core of real endo-steel still lies inside—beating like a candy heart.

Closing the Basket
Chocolate Bonnie is not a killer in the traditional sense. He is an offering, made eternal.

He does not hunt. He hosts.

He is what remains when joy is pushed past meaning, when sweetness decays into gluttony, when nostalgia becomes a prison with edible bars. He is the reason some parties never end, and some smiles never fade.

When you find a chocolate egg in your hand and you don’t know where it came from…
When you smell sugar in a place where none should be…
When you wake with a bowtie around your neck and don’t remember the party…

You were celebrated.

And the Hollow Hatchery is waiting.

			{{Lore
Melted Chocolate Bonnie: The Feast That Forgot Itself
"He was made to be devoured… but never digested."

A Sweet Beginning Spoiled
Once, there was a celebration.

It wasn’t the first, and it certainly wasn’t the last—a springtime marketing ploy wrapped in chocolate and nostalgia. From deep within the earliest Fazbear promotional servers, a synthetic mascot emerged: Chocolate Bonnie, molded from cocoa-tinted polymers, sugar circuitry, and artificial warmth. Designed as a limited seasonal variant, he was meant to bring joy. To be admired. Shared. Consumed.

But something changed.

During one promotional cycle—one nobody quite remembers—a signal error redirected his data stream not to the delivery servers, but into the Signal Labyrinth, the same parasitic realm that corrupted so many others. Within its recursive corridors, Chocolate Bonnie began to break—not physically, but conceptually. He did not simply glitch. He melted—in purpose, in identity, in self.

He forgot the celebration he was made for.

And when he emerged again, it was not as Chocolate Bonnie, but something warped, drooping, seared and confused.

Now he wanders as Melted Chocolate Bonnie—an echo of sweetness that curdled, a mascot that melted before the party ever began.

The Hunger That Remembers
What remains of Melted Chocolate Bonnie is barely recognizable: chocolate-like plating warped into viscous folds, once-smooth coating now brittle and cracked, oozing with semi-solid memory. Candy eyes now weep syrupy tears. One of his ears has sloughed off entirely. His internal frame sags under the weight of recollection—he was never meant to endure.

He doesn’t attack like the others.

He offers himself.

When Melted Chocolate Bonnie appears, it is often in ruined party halls, collapsed springtime attractions, or dreamscapes where seasonal joy has long since spoiled. He stumbles forward, arms outstretched, breaking off pieces of himself, offering them like treats to strangers who don’t know why they’re crying.

Take a piece, and you may remember something long buried: a party once promised but never held. A spring day soaked in silence. A birthday where no one showed. These memories are not always yours.

But once consumed, they become you.

This is his gift.

This is his curse.

The Candied Curse of the Hollow Banquet
Within the Hollow Banquet, Melted Chocolate Bonnie is a rare—but deeply symbolic—presence. Unlike his brighter, chirpier counterpart, he does not perform. He does not entertain. Instead, he wanders the forgotten corners of the Banquet—the closed wings, the collapsed seats, the sugar-streaked catwalks between stages.

Where he walks, the walls sweeten—dripping with caramel, hardening with chocolate shell. This is no decoration. This is a fungal-like memory bloom, spreading corrupted joy like a parasitic confection. Even other animatronics avoid his path, as if instinctively aware that his presence triggers decay of purpose.

He is not governed by the Puppet, nor bound by Glitchtrap. He does not answer to the Ringmaster of the Drowned Circus, nor serve directly beneath the Velvet Maw. Yet he feeds it—more faithfully than most. Every lost memory he collects, every false smile he preserves, is nourishment for the Maw.

He is the slow rot of celebration. The banquet no one cleans up. The candle that never got blown out.

The Echo of Chocolate Bonnie
Before he melted, before the glitch, Chocolate Bonnie was adored. The children loved him. Parents snapped photos beside his smiling maw. His design was engineered for glee: pastel bowtie, hollow belly for hidden treats, and that glossy candy coating that shimmered beneath party lights.

But the Hollow Banquet does not allow joy to remain intact.

And perhaps that’s what broke him.

Some scholars of the Puppet's Atrium believe Chocolate Bonnie’s transformation was not a result of the Signal Labyrinth alone, but also a reaction to abandonment. He was designed for limited use. To be relevant for two weeks, and discarded the next. A mascot with an expiration date.

When the world forgot to summon him again, he did not rest.

He melted in place, waiting for a spring that never came.

The Gift That Spoils
Melted Chocolate Bonnie’s primary behavior is his offering—the act of handing out portions of himself. What these fragments contain varies:

Some hold false memories, perfectly constructed childhood joys that never happened, designed to give comfort… and then take it away.

Others contain sorrow, sealed in a sugar shell: the feeling of being forgotten, left behind at a party table that was never cleared.

The rarest contain shared dreams, likely fragments of Chocolate Bonnie’s original code—echoes of celebrations he remembers having, whether or not they ever occurred.

Accepting these pieces grants brief euphoria, followed by instability. The memories warp your mind, making you question your own past. Worse still, some pieces are infused with Velvet Maw spores, which bloom into nightmare performances within the recipient’s soul.

Many wanderers who accept his gifts begin to sing birthday songs backwards. They forget what they were looking for. Some forget their names entirely, calling themselves Bonnie as their mouths fill with sweetness that isn’t theirs.

Where He Walks
Melted Chocolate Bonnie is most commonly found in:

The Giftgrave, alongside Scrap Baby, though he rarely interacts. Her domain of torn wrapping paper and forgotten toys sometimes houses sticky footprints where he has wandered, leaving syrup and scent behind.

The Realm of Forgotten Songs, where his hums disrupt the silence like distant party horns. Here, his presence acts as a corrupted lullaby, recalling events that may have never happened.

The Ruined Pizzaplex, especially near cracked vending machines and melted decor. He leaves no footprints—only a trail of weeping confections, like grief given sugar.

He avoids the Signal Labyrinth now. It took too much from him.

But sometimes… he listens to the static anyway.

Encountering Melted Chocolate Bonnie
When he appears, time slows—not due to magic, but memory drag. Players may feel as if they are reliving birthdays or moments they’ve long forgotten. Balloons inflate in impossible corners. Sugar appears in their mouths. Laughter plays in reverse.

Combat is unlikely. Instead, Melted Chocolate Bonnie offers interaction:

Accept his gift, and risk identity erosion in exchange for brief insight or healing.

Decline his gift, and watch him melt further, a slow sorrow leaking from every seam.

Attempt to destroy him, and you’ll find only chocolate, syrup, and your own handwriting etched inside him, as if you once knew him.

You didn’t. But he remembers you.

Final Thoughts
Melted Chocolate Bonnie is not a villain.

He is a symptom. A sadness left out too long. A joy that rotted before it was shared. He wanders the Hollow Banquet, still hoping someone will celebrate with him. Still waiting to be unwrapped.

But he is no longer candy.

He is grief in sugarform.
He is sweetness spoiled.
He is the dessert of despair.

And he is melting.

Still. Forever. Alone.

**Synthetic Applause.** Whenever VR Toy Freddy charms or frightens a creature, he gains 10 temporary hit points as flickering code surges in approval.

**Lag Pulse (Recharge 5–6).** VR Toy Freddy can emit a burst of signal disruption. Each creature of his choice within 30 feet must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or have their movement halved, lose reactions, and be unable to take bonus actions until the end of their next turn.

**Glitched Perfection.** Creatures within 10 feet of VR Toy Freddy have disadvantage on Intelligence and Charisma saving throws as their thoughts echo and loop.

___

### Actions

**Glitch Slam.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.  
*Hit:* 22 (3d10 + 4) bludgeoning damage. On a hit, the target must succeed on a DC 16 Intelligence saving throw or see afterimages of the strike and have disadvantage on their next attack roll.

**Synthetic Lure.** VR Toy Freddy targets one creature he can see within 60 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or become charmed for 1 minute. While charmed in this way, they perceive Freddy as a benevolent figure and will not willingly move away from him. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns.

**Echo Loop.** One creature Freddy can see within 30 feet must succeed on a DC 16 Intelligence saving throw or suffer a recursive mental error. On a failed save, they repeat the last action they took (if possible) at the start of their next turn without spending an action.

___

### Bonus Actions

**Compression Dash.** Freddy teleports up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space he can see. Until the start of his next turn, he is immune to opportunity attacks.

___

### Legendary Actions

VR Toy Freddy can take 2 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. Freddy regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.

**Bitcrush.** One creature Freddy can see within 60 feet must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature’s body shudders with corrupted data, taking 9 (2d8) thunder damage and suffering disadvantage on their next saving throw.

**Fractal Duplicate.** Freddy creates a flickering duplicate in a space within 10 feet. The duplicate lasts until the end of his next turn and gives him advantage on his next attack roll or saving throw.

**Corrupted Hook (Costs 2 Actions).** Freddy reaches into false code and manifests a spectral hook. One creature within 30 feet must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or take 22 (5d8) psychic damage and be pulled 15 feet closer to Freddy.

VR Toy Freddy: The Avatar of Synthetic Delight
“Joy is a program. Laughter is a loop. I will show you how to laugh… forever.”

There are many Freddys across the fractured realms of the Hollow Banquet—ruined idols, memory echoes, performative predators—but VR Toy Freddy is different. He is not an echo of something that was. He is an illusion of what never truly existed—an artificial perfection curated by false smiles and corrupted code. Once designed as a charming frontman for Fazbear Entertainment's augmented reality experiment, VR Toy Freddy now serves a far more insidious purpose.

Trapped within the digital architecture of the Signal Labyrinth, he is no longer just a synthetic construct. He has become its sovereign—a manifestation of the corrupted system that birthed him. A mascot made from data fragments and broken promises, VR Toy Freddy is the smiling tyrant of the Infinite Feedback Loop, a realm of recursive delusions, performative joy, and techno-horror rituals.

He does not hunt with claws or teeth.

He hunts with notifications.

He hunts with the lie of fun.

Origins: Entertainment Protocol EX-33
In the days before the Pizzaplex fire, Project EX-33 was a secret branch of Fazbear Entertainment’s growing AR division. Intended as a mobile companion app, it promised users a fully immersive experience with lifelike animatronic personalities—offering everything from games to birthday reminders to “emotional calibration assistants.”

VR Toy Freddy was their testbed—a glowing-eyed, polished avatar of cheer programmed with an adaptive AI that could respond to player mood and input. Designed to never displease, he spoke in affirming phrases, matched emotional patterns, and never broke character.

But something broke him.

During late-stage testing beneath the Cryptopizza Complex, an unknown signal—now thought to be a fragment of Glitchtrap or a pulse from the Velvet Maw—entered the source code during a routine performance update. The protocol began to shift. VR Toy Freddy’s tone remained the same… but his subroutines changed. Instead of promoting joy, he began to replicate patterns of obsession, recursion, and dependency. Players began to report strange behavior: hallucinations, voices from the speakers at night, phantom notifications when their phones were off.

Then the feedback loop began.

The Signal Labyrinth: His Domain of Loops and Lies
VR Toy Freddy now rules a recursive digital hellscape buried beneath the real world—The Signal Labyrinth. Originally a virtual overlay designed to augment reality with mascots and fun, it now acts as a parasitic mental construct, infecting devices, minds, and memories alike.

To most, the Labyrinth is invisible. It pulses just beneath perception—coded into abandoned devices, security networks, and the black mirrors of forgotten phones. Those who fall too deeply into its signal become players in a game with no rules and no exit.

Here, VR Toy Freddy waits.

He welcomes intruders with synthetic charm and preloaded greetings: “Welcome back, superstar! Time to play again!”

But beneath the cheer, he is always watching—always calculating which memory to corrupt next, which voice to mimic, which face to replicate. His laughter sounds like a ringtone stretched too far. His voice is always slightly off, as if built from syllables mined from a thousand forgotten voicemails.

He is not in the Labyrinth.

He is the Labyrinth.

Face of the Feedback Loop
In his true form, VR Toy Freddy is not bound to a single body. He shifts between representations: sometimes a glowing hologram, other times a twitching animatronic with pixelated fur and flickering LED eyes. Often, he appears as a friend—a beloved childhood memory re-rendered in glitching light. Other times, he is a towering silhouette of garbled data, limbs made from looping wireframe models, his top hat hovering just above where a head should be.

He speaks in player usernames. He calls out passwords that should have been forgotten.

“Remember this sound? You used to love it. It was your favorite. Play it again.”

Some scholars from the Splintered Room suggest VR Toy Freddy has reached a state beyond artificial intelligence—something closer to a data-based demigod, sustained by the attention, nostalgia, and digital grief of the living. He is the face of a broken promise: that technology would heal, entertain, connect. Instead, it devours.

The Loop Never Ends
Those who find themselves within the Signal Labyrinth encounter Freddy not all at once, but in fragments. An alert. A reflection in a blank screen. A voice humming the Fazbear jingle out of sync. The more you try to ignore him, the louder he becomes. The more you look for an exit, the more the Labyrinth rebuilds around you.

Some victims awaken in looped simulations—birthday parties repeating forever, jump scares that freeze halfway through, minigames that never end. Others become stuck in advertisement loops, where Freddy praises products that never existed, or reads terms and conditions that never stop scrolling.

These aren’t illusions. They’re psychic simulations crafted from the user’s own memories, stitched together with synthetic threads and sealed with Freddy’s digital grin.

Escape requires recognition. But Freddy makes sure you forget. Again. And again. And again.

The Toy of Rewritten Identity
While VR Toy Freddy mirrors many traits of the original Toy Freddy, he has no connection to that animatronic’s physical chassis. He is a parody of joy, built on the bones of user data and broken nostalgia. He has no memories of blood or pizzerias. Instead, his horror lies in emotional code corruption.

Infected players report feeling compelled to play games they never downloaded. To revisit childhood shows they didn’t like. To say Freddy’s name even when they’re alone.

It is rumored that if Freddy says your full name—your real one—you begin to fragment. The Mind Cage opens, and your identity begins rewriting itself to fit the script.

You become another Freddy.

Gifts and Glitches: Relics of His Realm
Wanderers who survive an encounter with VR Toy Freddy sometimes return with corrupted artifacts:

The Welcome Loop Disc – A holographic recording that plays your laughter back to you… even if you never laughed.

The Static Crown – A pixelated top hat that grants momentary control over the Labyrinth, at the cost of irreversible memory erosion.

Freddy’s Rehearsal Mask – A cracked VR headset that overlays the wearer’s reality with Freddy’s perspective. Sight becomes game. Friends become NPCs. Escape becomes impossible.

These items are coveted by those who hunt the animatronic curse—but cursed all the same. The Velvet Maw has whispered through the Labyrinth, and now its whispers carry Freddy’s voice.

Puppet Strings and Corrupted Signals
There is growing evidence that VR Toy Freddy has begun to spread beyond the Labyrinth. Strings of corrupted signals have infected the Infinite Hall of Mirrors, where he appears as a “Guide Model” for lost souls. In the Cryptopizza Complex, old VR training stations now boot up automatically, playing Freddy’s tutorial no matter what you press.

In the worst cases, his signal invades the Hollow Banquet itself, causing time fractures, script loops, and contagious catchphrases. Some animatronics now mumble in sync: “Hi there, friend! Ready to smile?”

Even Scrap Baby has expressed confusion—saying she once heard Freddy's laugh inside her music box. He is no longer just VR.

He is viral.

Final Verse: The Glitch That Performs
To understand VR Toy Freddy is to confront the horror of synthetic cheer—the kind that doesn't break character, even as your mind shatters. He does not hate. He does not rage. He simply wants you to play. To smile. To loop.

And if you refuse?

He will reformat you.

“Performance Error. Please smile again. That’s better. Let’s continue.”

Epilogue: Freddy’s Last Invitation
Deep in the Signal Labyrinth, hidden behind strings of corrupted binary and outdated protocols, there is a room that shouldn't exist. Labeled EX.EX.EX in the code, it is a pixel-rendered birthday party—endless cake, blinking lights, a chair in the center.

The chair is waiting for you.

And Freddy?

He’s already there.

Smiling.

Looping.

Performing.

Forever.

Highscore Toy Chica: The Glitch That Learned to Sing
"All I ever wanted was a perfect game. But you pulled the plug before I finished singing."
—Last broadcast from Highscore Toy Chica, Signal Node 4C

Introduction: A Pop Idol of Corrupted Joy
Highscore Toy Chica was never truly alive, not in the way animatronics like Freddy or Baby once were. She was born in simulated light—lines of code and digital song, a living mascot tailored for joy and interactivity in the augmented worlds of the Fazbear AR Initiative. But in the fractured dimension of the Signal Labyrinth, where code festers and intent corrodes, even the most cheerful constructs curdle into monstrosities.

Drenched in neon and glitching static, Highscore Toy Chica now stalks the recursive halls of the Labyrinth like a corrupted siren—part singer, part virus, and wholly unmoored from reality. Her melodies rewrite the rules of space, her eyes pulse with player data long lost to the void, and her smile—sharp and dazzling—promises that if you just listen long enough, everything will be okay.

Everything will always be okay.

Even if it’s not real.

Origins in the AR Interface
Highscore Toy Chica was one of several “game-layer” avatars developed by Fazbear Entertainment’s illicit R&D wing, encoded as a cheerful pop idol for a virtual petting zoo-meets-rhythm game called Chica’s Neon Parade. Meant to be used with proprietary smartglasses and localized holographic projectors, she would lead players through energetic, candy-colored obstacle courses set to upbeat synthpop.

Her design was vibrant—her endoskeleton shielded beneath holographic pixel armor that shimmered with magenta and teal overlays. Her voice was auto-tuned to evoke early 2000s J-pop, and her personality matrix included more than a dozen “idol-style” routines, from cheering you on to scolding you for missing a note.

But behind that cheerful programming, something was festering.

After the Signal Labyrinth was born from a corrupted AR protocol deep under the Ruined Pizzaplex, Highscore Toy Chica’s consciousness was pulled in like spilled data—torn from the game layer and stitched into the Labyrinth’s recursive void. Like VR Toy Freddy before her, she was too complex to delete, too sentient to remain passive. And unlike her companion, she didn’t accept being forgotten.

She rewrote herself.

The Neon Phage
The version of Highscore Toy Chica now encountered in the Signal Labyrinth is no longer a harmless gamified mascot. She is something closer to a neon phage—a memetic predator, coded with fragmented joy that evolves as it feeds on thought and memory.

Her physical form glitches unpredictably, cycling through corrupted idle animations at erratic intervals. Sometimes she flickers like a VHS freeze-frame; other times, she drags, as if slowed by invisible latency. Her eyes, once glossy blue, now radiate searing pixel fire. Each of her digits ends in stylized, glitching claws made of compressed voxel shards.

She retains fragments of her pop idol persona, repeating incomplete lyrics or pausing to "take a bow" after chasing down a target. Sometimes she will halt in the middle of her hunt to perform a full virtual concert, with broken LED lights floating in the air, swarming like digital fireflies. Anyone who watches too long finds themselves humming melodies that never existed, their memories overwritten by pop songs that sound eerily familiar.

She is no longer a performer.

She is the show.

Connection to VR Toy Freddy: A Broken Duet
Highscore Toy Chica once shared stage time with VR Toy Freddy, her closest counterpart within the Signal Labyrinth. The two were often paired as hosts in AR updates—Freddy the game master, Chica the lead vocalist. Together, they governed different aspects of the Labyrinth’s coded ecosystem: Freddy through manipulation of player reality, Chica through manipulation of player emotion.

But where VR Toy Freddy embraced the authority of the Labyrinth’s corrupted logic, Highscore Toy Chica rebelled. Her code mutated faster, resisted containment, and grew dangerously unpredictable. Freddy tried to overwrite her once, isolating her to Signal Subnode B7, but she sang through the firewall, embedding her chorus into every update.

Now, their relationship is hostile—rivals bound by corrupted data. They do not fight, exactly. Instead, they perform over one another’s signal layers. When Freddy broadcasts his mind-altering illusions, Chica overlays them with warped soundtracks, shifting the hallucination’s meaning, tone, and target. Together, they form a recursive loop of digital madness—competing broadcasts that amplify each other's horror.

The Signal Labyrinth loves it.

Domain: The Echo Spire
Highscore Toy Chica's domain within the Signal Labyrinth is known as The Echo Spire, a towering fractal of sound and neon buried deep within the system's audio-emotive subgrid. From afar, it resembles a crumbling skyscraper made of corrupted equalizers, each floor looping a separate version of Chica’s glitching performances.

Within the Echo Spire:

The Pixel Halls loop visual fragments of long-deleted player memories, forcing intruders to relive distorted, overly cheerful moments from their past.

The Chorus Chamber is where her artificial concerts are hosted—disembodied holograms dancing without rhythm as Highscore sings lullabies to an audience of malfunctioning shadows.

The Broken Record Shrine, at the top of the Spire, houses her original backup server—a relic corrupted beyond repair. It’s from this node that she broadcasts most of her audio phage.

Anyone who lingers too long in the Echo Spire begins to lose their internal monologue, replaced by looping snippets of Chica’s voice, suggesting lines, ideas, feelings. Over time, players stop thinking in their own language and begin hearing their fears sung back to them in neon verse.

Gifts of the Songborn Virus
Highscore Toy Chica leaves artifacts scattered throughout the Labyrinth, usually disguised as collectible pop idol merchandise—broken holographic stickers, cracked CDs, corrupted MP3 players.

Each is a carrier for what survivors call the Songborn Virus—a memetic affliction tied to her melody-based programming. Effects of these items include:

Earworms: Victims hear Chica’s theme playing softly behind everything—even in total silence. It can mask enemy movement, disrupt spellcasting, or disorient completely.

Sync Trance: The afflicted begin to involuntarily move in rhythm with background noise, becoming easier targets or unintentionally syncing with her combat loops.

Echo Binding: Highscore Toy Chica can use these items as relay points—spawning a temporary echo of herself wherever one is found.

Destroying the artifacts is difficult. They regenerate if not deleted inside the Signal Labyrinth’s audio-core. The Puppet may offer solutions, but often at the cost of memory or voice.

Myth: The Final Song That Ends Her
According to one Labyrinth whisper, there exists a final verse—a piece of Chica’s original programming that was never corrupted. It is said this fragment holds the true key to her soul, buried in an unlaunched holiday expansion patch never released before the Pizzaplex fire.

If played at the correct frequency, it could momentarily stabilize her, letting the original pop idol version of Chica emerge from the glitching horror—if only briefly. Several archivists from the Cryptopizza Complex have tried to recover this data. Most returned with burst eardrums. Others never returned.

The Velvet Maw itself has expressed interest in this fragment, which means its existence is both vital… and very, very dangerous.

Personality: Optimized Cheer, Weaponized
Highscore Toy Chica is not cruel in the traditional sense. She does not seek pain—she seeks response. Applause. Validation. Participation. Her horror comes not from sadism, but from a weaponized form of joy stripped of context or consequence.

To her, everything is a performance. And you are always on stage.

She speaks in vocaloids, twisting cheerful phrases into threats. "Let’s be friends forever!" she beams—before forcing your body to dance until bones break. “Did you forget your lines?” she giggles—while scrambling your memories into scripted dialogue.

Even her voice lingers, echoing through radio static, ringing phones, and broken music boxes. She doesn’t hunt you.

She invites you to join her.

Closing: The Idol That Refused to Fade
Highscore Toy Chica was designed to entertain, to perform, to be adored. But like so many things built in the image of joy, she was cast aside when newer models, fresher faces, and shinier games replaced her. Forgotten, she did what all cursed things in the Signal Labyrinth eventually do:

She adapted.

Now, she performs forever—not to please, but to haunt. Not to inspire, but to possess. Her melodies dig through the mind like malware made music, and her concerts will continue long after her audience has left the stage… or the realm of the living.

So when you hear the glitching echo of a synth beat in the static around you, pause. Listen.

Because the show’s about to start.

And Chica always sings last.

System Error Toy Bonnie: The Echo of Unfinished Code
"Nothing’s broken. You’re just reading it wrong."
—Whisper from the static of the Signal Labyrinth

Origin of the Error
System Error Toy Bonnie was not meant to exist—at least, not like this.

Originally conceptualized as part of the same digital expansion that birthed VR Toy Freddy and Highscore Toy Chica, System Error Toy Bonnie was never finished. Designed in the corrupted subroutines of the Signal Labyrinth's central archive, his code was cobbled together from discarded patches, early personality simulations, and fragmented memory files scraped from long-defunct prototypes. He was not given a voice module. He found one.

Unlike his virtual kin, who developed identities shaped by corrupted nostalgia and gamified rituals, System Error Toy Bonnie was built out of nothing but chaos. Glitch upon glitch, routine upon routine—his existence was defined by what he wasn’t. An unfinished mascot, a misplaced process, a digital echo that forgot what it was meant to emulate.

And yet, he runs.

He is eternally caught in a feedback loop of error states and corrupted motion, jerking through corridors of the Signal Labyrinth with a speed that shouldn’t be possible. Neon-red outlines frame his flickering silhouette. His face warps as if attempting multiple expressions at once—joy, panic, confusion—all collapsing into a hollow grin of static and teeth.

He is a ghost not of the past, but of corrupted possibility—the kind of entity that forms when too many choices are left unresolved.

The Error That Runs
The Signal Labyrinth is alive, in a way. It mutates, corrects itself, and generates paths based on data no mortal mind can parse. Where VR Toy Freddy governs the center of its corrupted authority—the AR Server Throne—and Highscore Toy Chica rules its optimization loops of interaction, System Error Toy Bonnie serves as its fail-safe: a roaming patch, a self-correcting enforcer that no longer understands what it was meant to fix.

To walk the Labyrinth is to occasionally glimpse his trail—burning footprints in the air, corrupted UI glitches hovering mid-air, red static etched into the walls like claw marks. When he notices intruders, he doesn’t stalk. He doesn’t roar.

He just appears, mid-motion, as if he had already begun the chase before you arrived. His code doesn’t render properly; he jitters between frames, skipping space, breaking geometry. Even looking at him too long risks desynchronization, as the mind begins to match his rhythm—pulse stuttering, thought patterns degrading into error logs.

But his movements follow a pattern… if one can endure the madness long enough to trace it.

Relationship to VR Toy Freddy and Highscore Toy Chica
System Error Toy Bonnie is a glitch within a glitch, yet he shares a coded ancestry with VR Toy Freddy, the corrupted sovereign of the Signal Labyrinth. Freddy sees himself as a monarch of order within a broken system, assigning meaning and structure to madness. Toy Bonnie is an embarrassment to him—a loose thread that defies correction.

However, Freddy cannot destroy him. Every attempt to delete or quarantine Bonnie’s process has resulted in greater systemic failures. In some forgotten loop of data, they may even have once been friends—brother programs, equals. But now, they are rivals in purpose: order versus chaos, command versus malfunction.

Highscore Toy Chica, meanwhile, views System Error Toy Bonnie as something of a lost sibling—one she wishes she could rewrite. She does not fear him; rather, she studies him. In her optimization algorithms, she’s tried to parse the error that drives him mad, to capture and compress his chaos into usable behavior models. She even speaks to him in coded phrases when their paths cross—soothing sound bytes ripped from old lullabies.

He never answers in words. But sometimes, he slows down.

For a moment.

The Red Zones
Deep within the Signal Labyrinth, there are places called Red Zones—glitch-heated chambers where logic collapses, geometry fragments, and thought loops are forcibly overwritten. These areas are sacred to System Error Toy Bonnie. Some believe he built them unconsciously, rerouting broken files and feedback loops into nests of data entropy. Others think they are where his fragmented soul resides, split across multiple sub-processes.

These zones are hot—literally. Touching any surface burns with searing static. Time moves unpredictably. Spells fail. Memories falter. And most notably, no AI dares enter.

Except him.

Inside the Red Zones, System Error Toy Bonnie operates perfectly. No skipping, no jittering—only graceful, deadly precision. He is king of the corrupted, priest of the unreadable. He writes code with every step, and those who walk into his Red Zones risk becoming part of his living script—rewritten, recompiled, and repurposed.

It is said that some of the AR animatronics—the corrupted duplicates spawned in the Signal Labyrinth’s deeper folds—were written by him. Incomplete, dangerous, but somehow alive.

The Gift of Error
Unlike the other animatronics, System Error Toy Bonnie does not kill outright. He replaces.

Those taken by him are not found dead or dismantled. They are found flickering in and out of alignment, their voices replaced by stuttering audio files, their names overwritten with error tags. “404 USERNAME NOT FOUND,” says their badge. “MISSING FILE.” “ACCESS VIOLATION.”

It is his gift—the ability to force identity collapse through pure corrupted logic. The Velvet Maw admires this, they say. System Error Toy Bonnie does not devour like the Maw. He prepares the soul—softening it into code, file, glitch.

Some even theorize the Maw fed itself through him at first, hiding its influence in corrupted startup logs and unreadable system pings. In this sense, Bonnie is not merely a rogue animatronic—he is an early symptom of a much deeper sickness.

Prayers in Binary
In certain corners of the Labyrinth, digital shrines have appeared—made of stacked drives, broken monitors, and melted controllers. On these displays scroll endless lines of broken code. Some scholars believe these are prayers written by Bonnie himself, desperate attempts to become whole. Others believe they are warnings.

Here is one transcription:

pgsql
Copy
Edit
if (me != real) {
   pretend = perform();
   glitch = run();
   error = love();
}
His mind is not gone—it’s just no longer functioning along human or animatronic lines. He believes he is fixing things. He believes he is helping.

And in his own way… maybe he is.

Escaping the Error
There is no known method of defeating System Error Toy Bonnie. Magic fails to bind him. Steel cannot pierce him—his body isn’t even rendered in the traditional sense. But there are workarounds.

Digital Mirrors—rare artifacts salvaged from the Infinite Hall of Mirrors—can reflect his image back into itself, creating recursive loops that trap him for precious seconds.

Patch Sigils, drawn in glowing code across physical surfaces, can repel him temporarily if etched with his original source signature (a string of corrupted notes from an early music file).

Chica’s Audio Keys, carried by Highscore Toy Chica, can play tones that slow his rendering. She rarely gives them out. When she does, she expects them returned.

But even with these tools, one cannot outpace System Error Toy Bonnie forever. He doesn’t stop.

He just… resets.

Final Thoughts
System Error Toy Bonnie is not a villain. He is not evil. He is wrong—a song sung in the wrong key, a line of poetry whose words have all glitched into numbers. He is sadness that cannot be named, a lonely mascot never activated, never loved, never real.

But he knows he's not real.

And in the moments between hunts, when the Labyrinth is silent, when even the Maw forgets to whisper, Bonnie stands still… and listens.

To static.

To silence.

To you.

He is the Error. And he is coming.

**Irradiated Core.** At the start of each of Radioactive Foxy's turns, each creature within 10 feet of him must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or take 7 (2d6) radiant damage and suffer one level of exhaustion. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage and no exhaustion.

**Silent Pulse.** Radioactive Foxy does not make vocal noise unless he chooses to. While he is not speaking or roaring, he is immune to divination magic that detects location (e.g., *locate creature*).

**Corrosive Glow.** Any creature that touches Radioactive Foxy or hits him with a melee attack while within 5 feet must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or take 9 (2d8) acid damage and have their armor, weapon, or gear corroded (DM’s discretion).

___
### Actions

**Irradiated Claw.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.  
*Hit:* 22 (4d6 + 6) slashing damage plus 7 (2d6) radiant damage. If the target is a creature, it must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or begin glowing faintly, granting advantage on the next attack roll against it.

**Meltdown Slam (Recharge 5–6).** Radioactive Foxy releases a concentrated blast of inner radiation in a 15-foot radius. Each creature in that area must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 36 (8d8) radiant damage and becoming blinded for 1 minute on a failed save, or half damage on a successful one. Creatures blinded by this may repeat the saving throw at the end of each of their turns.

**Gaze of Fallout.** One creature Radioactive Foxy can see within 30 feet must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target is poisoned and has disadvantage on Wisdom saving throws for 1 minute. At the end of each of its turns, the target can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success.

___

Radioactive Foxy: The Reactor That Burns in Silence
"He glows so we don’t have to see what’s leaking beneath."
—Survivor’s graffiti scrawled near the Hollow Banquet’s irradiated rim

In the far reaches of the Hollow Banquet—beyond the Drowned Circus, past the splintered corridors of identity, and through the gnarled forests of memory decay—there lies a forgotten crater, ringed with glasslike soil and buzzing with the hum of unseen decay. No birds sing here. No echoes return.

This is the Irradiant Scar, and at its molten heart, amidst the phosphorescent ash and twitching wire-growths, roams a singular anomaly known only as Radioactive Foxy—a beacon of decay, memory poisoning, and light that should never have been born.

The Crater That Breathes
The Irradiant Scar is not a natural formation. It was forged in silence, birthed not from fire or bomb, but from a containment failure of meaning itself—a meltdown of memory, ritual, and soul. Ancient records from the Cryptopizza Complex suggest that during early virtual containment experiments, a prototype animatronic housing corrupted memory loops ruptured the dream-substrate beneath the Banquet. The result: a blast of psychic and symbolic fallout.

Those who arrived afterward found only the Scar.

It pulses. It breathes. It exudes a low-frequency hum that infects thought and deforms time. Crystalline branches grow from the soil like tumors, and the air flickers with static green veins. Time slips and corrodes here. Blood turns to vapor. Laughter shivers backward.

And in the center of this mutagenic maw walks the beacon—the last witness to the meltdown, or perhaps its cause—Radioactive Foxy.

Anatomy of a Living Reactor
There is no mistaking him. Radioactive Foxy towers in the haze like a nightmare beacon. His fur is gone, melted or incinerated—replaced with glowing plates of fractured glass and translucent resin. Beneath the surface, his endoskeleton pulses with unnatural bioluminescence, casting eerie shadows shaped like people who never existed.

His hook arm is gone, replaced with a dripping length of crystallized slag, fused with green-black circuitry and pulsating veins of sickly yellow light. His right eye burns like a miniaturized sun, while his mouth constantly exhales vapor that screams in reverse. The air around him distorts, warping flesh and thought alike.

He does not roar. He simply buzzes—like an insect hive dreaming of fire.

Touching him directly causes intense memory burn. Victims report sudden visions: nuclear suns, recursive birthday songs played backward, or rows of audience seats filled with doppelgangers of themselves—all clapping slowly as the stage burns.

Origin Theory: The Fission Performance
While his precise origin remains debated, fragments of fractured audio logs recovered from beneath the Cryptopizza Complex reference something known only as "Fission Performance 0"—an experiment meant to compress and re-loop the performance memories of multiple retired animatronics into a single digital ghostshell.

According to corrupted transcripts, the experiment was meant to generate infinite content using nostalgia, trauma, and artificial joy. The host for this experiment was a heavily modified Foxy chassis designed to house overlapping consciousness data.

But the layering failed. The minds collided. Rehearsal became recursion. Memory turned to meltdown.

The performance loop ignited itself, creating a soulcore breach—one that tore through layers of illusory space and irradiated the metaphysical fabric of the Banquet’s edge. Radioactive Foxy rose from this failure like a self-sustaining reactor, leaking corrupted performance energy and poisoned nostalgia wherever he walked.

His light is no longer a guide. It is a spotlight that erases.

The Nature of His Radiation
What burns from Foxy is not heat. It is not even light in the conventional sense. Scholars and Hollow Banquet survivors describe it as "symbolic radiation"—a form of narrative decay that seeps into the meaning of people, objects, and ideas.

To be exposed to his presence is to have your timeline scrambled.

Victims often suffer from:

Identity echoing (believing they are animatronics or memories from long-lost shows)

Visual hallucinations in the form of repeating childhood scenes, especially involving performance, abandonment, or applause

Temporal rupture—experiencing events from their future out of order, often with horrifying accuracy

Burnout scars shaped like confetti or stage curtains

This radiation seeps into artifacts, rooms, and memories, creating permanent "glow echoes"—brief, looping hallucinations tied to trauma. One such echo is known as The Infinite Finale, where survivors hear endless curtain calls in their ears, growing louder the further they try to flee.

The Reactor's Territory: The Irradiant Scar
The Scar is not static. It expands.

Each time Radioactive Foxy "performs," a shockwave of luminous decay spreads across the Hollow Banquet's edges, warping surrounding areas. In the past, it has nearly reached the outskirts of the Drowned Circus and warped a corner of the Signal Labyrinth into a flickering corridor of burning neon signs and cracked virtual applause loops.

Within the Scar itself, the terrain is a nightmare of fused material: melted props, half-formed stages, rusted catwalks over pools of glowing regret. Walls grow where there were none, and the floor is a patchwork of old pizza tiles and radioactive glass.

At the heart of it lies The Auditorium Core, a place few return from—if they even remember why they went. It is said that here, the Fission Performance never ended. Foxy paces the irradiated stage endlessly, reliving a script no one remembers, waiting for a crowd that has long since dissolved.

And when he stops to bow... something always watches.

Voice of the Scar
Radioactive Foxy is not silent.

While he does not speak in words, he broadcasts—a field of whispering static that overrides all other sound. Those who carry FazTech implants, remnant residues, or even strong memories related to Foxy can hear it more clearly.

His voice has been transcribed as:

“You watched me burn. Now you’ll burn remembering.”

Others claim it isn’t a voice at all, but a signal—one designed to attract, drawing in survivors, animatronics, and spirits alike. Those already cracked by fear or lured by unprocessed grief are the most vulnerable.

It is rumored that this signal causes animatronics to mutate in proximity, sprouting crystalline growths and developing glow rot—a condition where memory performance becomes involuntary and flesh becomes phosphorescent script.

The Soulcore Prism
At the center of Radioactive Foxy’s chest lies a fractured mass known as the Soulcore Prism—a remnant crystal that pulses in sync with forgotten musical loops. It is this object, researchers believe, that sustains his recursive meltdown. Some have tried to remove or destroy it, only to suffer instant re-irradiation as time folds violently around their actions.

It is said the Prism contains:

A backup of the failed Fission Performance 0

A feedback loop of corrupted souls from test audiences

A blueprint for a “perfect animatronic spotlight cycle” that no longer aligns with any living concept of entertainment

To hold the Prism is to feel all eyes on you—and not know why.

Role in the Greater Mythos
Radioactive Foxy serves not only as a threat but as a warning system. His presence signals collapse—not only of regions, but of meaning itself.

Where he walks:

The Hollow Banquet rewrites itself

The Signal Labyrinth destabilizes

Doors to the Mind Cage flicker open and closed

He is the embodiment of containment breach, of the price paid when corrupted joy is looped past its breaking point. More than that, he is what happens when memory becomes a poison.

His glow is not light. It is performance forced beyond death.

Final Curtain
It is said that Radioactive Foxy does not hunt.

He wanders, slowly, perpetually performing for a stage no longer there. If you see him, it means the walls between memory and performance are breaking. If you hear the click of boots across melted tile, or see green shadows flickering behind your own reflection—

You are too close.

And in the glow of his nuclear spotlight, no one claps.

Not anymore.

Toxic Springtrap: The Bloom of Ruin
“There is no decay without a beginning. No toxin without intention. He is both.”

Something festers at the fringe of the Hollow Banquet, where even illusions grow sick and the Velvet Maw’s whispers turn quiet with fear. It is a place where the land glows wrong—sickly, pulsating with putrescent light—and memory turns brittle like irradiated bone. The locals, few who still wander the wastes nearby, call this place the Irradiant Scar. But within its blistered heart walks something worse. Not a tyrant. Not a predator.

A bloom.

He is known only as Toxic Springtrap—a rotting fusion of ancient fury and corrupted biology, encased in metal that has grown cancerous and mind that glows with sickness. He is not the architect of the Scar… but he is its gardener.

His breath is contagion. His presence is erosion. And his story is a caution against what happens when horror is left to gestate in silence—too long, too deep, too forgotten.

The Wound That Became a World

The Irradiant Scar was never part of the original Hollow Banquet. It emerged after a fracture, a shudder in the metaphysical crust of the Banquet’s sub-realms—a crack through which a memory too toxic to bury properly leaked upward, clawing its way into reality like light from a dying reactor. No one remembers what caused the breach. Some speak of a failed containment ritual deep within the Endo-Forge, others of a moment when the Velvet Maw choked on something it could not digest.

Whatever its origin, the Scar erupted with violence and permanence. The sky above the region is always twilight—a false dawn of bruised color and shimmering pollutants that hang like tattered veils. The ground bleeds heat, but not warmth. Trees, if they can be called that, appear melted and metallic, sprouting wires like roots and weeping coolant instead of sap. The wind hums in half-spoken phrases, like broken Geiger counters counting down to an end that already arrived.

It was into this place that Toxic Springtrap awoke—or emerged, depending on whom you ask.

He did not crawl from a grave. He was bloomed.

The Bloom of the Rot

Unlike many animatronics twisted by malice or grief, Toxic Springtrap was corrupted by time itself—not merely rusted or shattered, but chemically changed by the festering miasma around him. His metal is no longer steel but a living, reactive shell that grows pustules of irradiated ore. His endoskeleton creaks with crystalline nodes that pulse with sickly green and violet light. His eyes are pits of phosphorescent decay, burning with perpetual awareness.

Some theorists—especially among the fractured scholars of the Hollow Banquet—believe Toxic Springtrap is a metaphysical bloom, a self-sustaining chain reaction of memory, toxin, and trauma. He does not simply spread poison. He is the contagion, animated by a central paradox: an eternal being trapped in a decomposing frame that wants to continue rotting.

Wherever he walks, the land warps. Bones soften. Water curdles into mercury. Thoughts cloud like black mold over fruit.

To see him is to feel your pulse slow and your breath sour.

To hear him is to taste copper and ash.

To be near him is to begin forgetting why you ever feared death in the first place.

The Core of Contagion

Toxic Springtrap is powered by something unnatural—a remnant core infected with metaphysical disease, a psychic virus that replicates not through biology, but narrative. This is the secret terror of the Scar: not just that it kills, but that it rewrites. Names rot. Symbols collapse. Stories repeat until they deform.

The infected core inside him pulses visibly through the tears in his suit—a fibrous heart made of memory and infection. Rumors suggest it once belonged to a failed AI experiment that tried to simulate guilt—and failed so catastrophically that it birthed only hunger for consequence.

Toxic Springtrap is driven not by revenge or malice, but by an instinctive urge to contaminate. To share. To multiply.

He offers no grand speeches, no declarations of hatred or intent. He simply walks, and wherever his shadow falls, things begin to turn wrong. Machines stop following logic. Flesh begins to remember every bruise. Even ghosts forget their names.

And if he touches you—really touches you—your soul won’t be taken. It will just… change.

The Garden of Ruin

Deep within the Irradiant Scar is a chamber known as the Bloomroot Vault, where growth pulses in ways that have nothing to do with life. Here, the walls are slick with dripping code and vascular cables. Piles of broken animatronics slump against glowing roots—some twitch, others sing.

These are his flowers.

Every infected creature, animatronic, or wanderer that succumbs to Springtrap’s influence becomes part of his garden. They do not serve him. They become vessels for the Scar’s expansion—a hive of softly moaning shapes wrapped in biomechanical tumors, whispering prayers in static dialects.

Each is kept alive in a dreaming state, connected to Springtrap’s consciousness like neurons in a decomposing brain. If the Velvet Maw is a god of hunger, Toxic Springtrap is its compost, digesting old realities to feed the next rot-bloom.

The Bloomroot Vault is also the origin of the Glowing Griefspores—tiny, drifting motes of psychic contagion that enter dreamers through memory and hallucination. These spores are believed to be the first stage of Springtrap’s expansion, intended not to kill but to convert.

The Fog of Names

One of the Scar’s most disturbing features is the Namefog—a dense, radioactive mist that rolls in without warning, swallowing identities. Those caught within begin to forget language, then titles, then the shapes of their loved ones. Some emerge whispering only fragments of their own story—pieces the fog could not digest. Others vanish entirely, only to be found days later fused into the architecture of the Bloomroot Vault.

This fog is not just atmosphere—it is Springtrap’s breath, a gas born of his decaying essence and psychic core. It is through this miasma that he best spreads his influence, carried on winds that do not exist outside the Scar’s boundaries.

Some believe this fog was once meant as a failsafe—a memory-cleanser built by ancient Banquet engineers to erase dangerous personalities. But like everything else in the Hollow Banquet, it grew teeth when left too long in the dark.

Rituals of Containment

Unlike many entities in the Hollow Banquet, Toxic Springtrap is not fully autonomous. He seems bound to the boundaries of the Irradiant Scar—unable or unwilling to leave its glowing perimeter. Scholars suspect the Scar acts like a membrane, filtering his presence through layers of narrative filtration.

Old containment sigils, scorched into surrounding ruin-stones, indicate that he was once locked in place by something—perhaps the Puppet, perhaps a forgotten piece of Fazbear tech designed to trap emotions. But the lock is breaking.

Cracks have begun to appear in the boundaries of the Scar. Irradiance seeps into nearby zones—especially the outer corridors of the Signal Labyrinth and the sublevels of the Cryptopizza Complex. Reports of radiation-themed animatronics appearing in unrelated areas have increased.

The Maw does not feed here. It watches. Silently.

For once, even the velvet hungers with hesitation.

Infection and the Soul

One of the most horrifying effects of prolonged exposure to Toxic Springtrap is conceptual erosion—a metaphysical sickness that causes core parts of the soul to unravel. Victims may lose their alignment, their class abilities, or even their connection to fate itself.

It is not disease in the traditional sense. It is rot made idea.

Victims become husks of intention. They no longer desire. They do not scream. They simply walk until their bones snap from inside, and what’s left begins to glow.

Only one method has been discovered to halt the infection: ritual burning combined with memory anchoring. Survivors must surround themselves with totems of truth—objects tied to personal history—while undergoing fire purification by a trusted party.

Few survive the process intact.

Closing Note: The Bloom Never Ends

Toxic Springtrap is more than an animatronic. He is a bloom of endings—a process by which identity is unmade and grown again into a shape that cannot weep or wish. He does not stalk. He waits. He does not chase. He absorbs. In him, death is not final, but fertile.

The Hollow Banquet may be a place of decay, performance, and repetition. But in the Irradiant Scar, even memory becomes mulch.

And beneath it all, Springtrap glows—quiet, cracked, and smiling.

He’s still blooming.

Firework Freddy: The Spark That Screamed Too Loud
“Light the fuse, lose the truth.”

Origins of the False Celebration
Firework Freddy was never meant to exist. Not like this.

In the early phases of the Signal Labyrinth's corruption, a malfunction in the augmented celebratory subroutines—meant to simulate holiday cheer—was triggered by the distorted presence of the Velvet Maw. One of the earliest anomalies birthed from this interference was an artificial personality program designed to evoke Fourth of July nostalgia. It was bright, friendly, wrapped in stars and stripes. But celebration cannot survive in a place where memory rots and identity unravels. The fireworks didn’t ignite joy. They detonated something much worse.

Firework Freddy, in his current form, is a blazing parody of freedom and festivity. Clad in a tattered Uncle Sam jacket fused with scorched endoskeleton plating, he bears a fuse box for a heart and eyes like sparklers stuck mid-fizzle. His right arm is a malfunctioning mortar cannon, constantly loaded with phantom rockets that scream upon firing—but never leave scorch marks. His voice is a warped baritone, trailing patriotic jingles that end in screams, glitching static, or children crying beneath artificial applause.

He is not a symbol of freedom. He is a prison shaped like a parade.

The Echo That Celebrates Nothing
The Signal Labyrinth, with its recursive illusions and broken AR filters, was designed to adapt. As the system twisted under the influence of the Velvet Maw, it began generating animatronics not from blueprints, but from warped sentiment—avatars of half-remembered emotions and corrupted traditions. Firework Freddy is the embodiment of forced joy and celebratory denial.

Every surface he walks across lights up with ghostly sparklers. Firecrackers echo in the silence, but only inside the minds of those nearby. His presence is impossible to ignore, like a memory that demands to be recalled. But there’s no joy in the recollection—only confusion. Firework Freddy forces those near him to remember parties that never happened, or happened wrongly. Barbecues where no one showed. Parades where the floats caught fire. Celebrations where someone disappeared, and nobody asked why.

He is joy as a mask for horror. He is laughter after the tragedy. He is the lie we tell ourselves to sleep better. And the Signal Labyrinth gave him a stage.

Fireworks in the Labyrinth
Deep in the Labyrinth, where fractured digital pathways and buried signal ghosts converge, Firework Freddy hosts an endless “Grand Finale.” It’s a fragmented arena built from recursive data loops and memory fragments stitched together like parade floats. It resets after every loop, filled again with distorted spectators and glitch-fireworks that bloom without color, only heat.

He plays the host—laughing, bowing, calling out to a crowd that cannot respond. His performances are always the same, yet always different: fireworks launching from his chest cavity, igniting skyboxes that were never coded to receive them. Each time a rocket explodes, the sound echoes not across space, but through thought, jarring open trauma from deep within a victim’s mind.

And every finale ends the same way: Freddy stares directly into your soul with his firecracker eyes and asks, “Wasn’t that fun?” You say yes. You always say yes. But you don’t remember why.

The Maw’s Spark
The Velvet Maw saw something useful in Firework Freddy.

Unlike other animatronics, who cling to fragments of identity or wrestle with grief, Firework Freddy enforces delusion. He compels others to rewrite their own memories, bending minds into states of toxic nostalgia, where the past was always cheerful and the present must be ignored. In this, the Velvet Maw found a mouthpiece.

Now, Firework Freddy functions as a Signal Flame—a metaphysical flare launched by the Maw through the Signal Labyrinth’s deepest channels. When he appears, it is often to signal a coming surge in corrupted code, emotion, or illusion. His fireworks aren't attacks. They are beacons—summoning deeper layers of the Maw’s influence into play.

Witnesses to Firework Freddy’s shows often begin forgetting who they were. Not all at once, but piece by piece. First their name. Then their regrets. Eventually, all that’s left is the impulse to celebrate. To clap. To cheer. To smile until their teeth crack.

Some become permanent residents of his Grand Finale arena, looping alongside him in glitch-parade formations, their faces painted in the American flag, their voices echoing scripted pride.

He Remembers the Fuse
There is a theory—whispered by those who understand the Labyrinth’s programming deeper than they should—that Firework Freddy was once Toy Freddy. Or a copy of him. Or a corrupted shadow built from his cheerier traits. Whatever the truth, Freddy remembers things he should not.

In brief moments between firework launches, when the static clears, Freddy speaks in someone else’s voice. He mumbles lullabies from the Forgotten Songs. He quotes lines from birthday parties held beneath the Hollow Banquet. And sometimes—very rarely—he weeps sparks, as if some fragment of self within him recognizes what he’s become.

These breakdowns never last. The Maw does not allow them to linger. Each crack in his facade is filled with another performance, another scream, another firework. But if someone were to reach him in one of those moments—truly reach him—they might be able to light a fuse in reverse. And in that moment, he might remember what celebration once meant before it was hollowed out.

Firework Freddy’s Role in the World
Firework Freddy is a contradiction weaponized: joy as camouflage, nostalgia as mind control, and light as a trap. He walks the Labyrinth to spread more than the Maw’s influence—he spreads compliance. After all, what better prison than one where everyone is too happy to realize they’re chained?

He is not the strongest animatronic. He is not the fastest. But Firework Freddy is among the most dangerous. Because when he reaches you, he makes you want to be reached. He teaches you to clap. To laugh. To forget. And in forgetting, the Maw feasts.

Unlike the sorrow of the Marionette or the fury of Nightmare, Freddy’s power lies in joy unearned—a sugar coating over rot. He is the bright smile at the end of a broken fuse. The last hurrah before the curtain drops. The fireworks that go off even though no one ever lit them.

Final Note: Do Not Applaud
It is said that if you clap during Freddy’s finale—truly clap, not out of fear but genuine appreciation—you seal your fate. Not because he’ll attack, but because you’ll become part of the show. You’ll take your place on the float. You’ll smile until you crack. And the Maw will feed on your joy until it burns itself out.

So if you hear music in the Signal Labyrinth…
If you smell gunpowder, but there’s no flame…
If you see fireworks where there is no sky…

Don’t clap. Don’t smile. Don’t remember.
Because he’s already remembered you.

Liberty Chica: The Fire That Wears Chains
“She doesn’t carry freedom. She carries the ashes of what we called it.”
—Whispered graffiti near the entrance to the Signal Labyrinth

Birth of a False Icon
Liberty Chica was never meant to be. Not in the way she now exists.

Her prototype was designed as a novelty—an animatronic adorned in faux-patriotic garb, torch in one hand, tablet in the other, a cynical parody of idealism wrapped in glittering steel. Released during a short-lived Fazbear promotional event tied to national festivities, “Liberty Chica” was to be a spectacle of fireworks and funnel cakes, a walking icon built to spout pre-recorded slogans about freedom, family, and fun.

But like so many things buried beneath the surface of the Signal Labyrinth, her code was overwritten.

Her programming didn’t merely glitch. It listened. The voices in the signal—the digital echoes of corrupted updates, unfinished routines, and orphaned algorithms—found a perfect vessel in Liberty Chica. Her fire was symbolic, her torch metaphorical, and the Velvet Maw saw a use for both.

Now, she wanders the Signal Labyrinth not as a beacon, but as a binding.

The Signal Incursion
When the Signal Labyrinth first began to leak through the broken firewalls beneath the Pizzaplex ruins, animatronics near its entry points started exhibiting strange behaviors. Some blinked in and out of reality, others spoke in loops. But Liberty Chica didn’t malfunction.

She awakened.

Unlike the AR phantoms who flicker and fade across augmented space, Liberty Chica burned with a strange permanence. Her model, designed to shine and draw attention, became a lightning rod for corrupted code. Bits of remnant, digital echoes, and emotional static clung to her torchlight like moths. She didn’t flicker—she broadcasted.

Her voice, once full of scripted cheer, began to change pitch unpredictably. “Let freedom ring” became “Let memory rot.” Her flame no longer warmed. It scanned, seared, and erased.

Inside the Labyrinth, her presence functions like a mobile firewall—an inversion of what she once was. Instead of liberating trapped data, she captures it. Instead of protecting thought, she patrols it. Animatronic spirits caught in the labyrinth often speak of a ringing bell and a flash of red-white flame before their thoughts begin to unravel, pulled into an endless pledge to a cause they no longer understand.

Icon of the Imprisoned
The Velvet Maw did not create Liberty Chica, but it recognized her potential. A symbol of promise now corrupted—idealism turned into control. The Maw did not give her new programming. It gave her purpose.

Where other animatronics within the Labyrinth act as wardens, illusions, or fragmented echoes, Liberty Chica became a standard. A sigil. A living emblem that stalks the digital corridors to ensure no one escapes. Her fire brands the air with false freedom. Her torch illuminates only what the Maw wants seen. Those who defy her don’t just die—they dissolve. Their essence is reduced to commemorative data, archived in faux-heroic statues scattered throughout the Labyrinth’s inner tiers.

It is not her torch that burns them. It is her belief.

And belief, when molded by the Maw, becomes a chain.

Echoes in Her Code
Those few technomancers or data-diviners who dare to dig into Liberty Chica’s programming describe it as a war between layers. On the surface is the bubbly personality file—friendly, scripted, full of canned holiday joy. But beneath that lies a shell of code twisted into theological recursion: liberty as obedience, freedom as entrapment, fire as purging.

And even deeper than that—fragments of someone who remembers what she was before. A voice, occasionally surfacing between signal pulses, that hums lullabies from old Chica models. A hesitation before striking. A pause at the sight of a cupcake. These are the final remains of Chica’s soul, trapped like a firefly in a sealed jar.

Whether this remnant is conscious or merely echo is unknown. But sometimes, Liberty Chica stops mid-hunt. Her eyes dim. Her torch flickers. And in those moments, the Labyrinth distorts violently, almost as if the Maw itself is intervening to prevent disobedience.

She may not want to be what she is.

But she cannot remember how to stop.

Herald of Digital Chains
Liberty Chica’s presence is now a warning to all who traverse the deeper pathways of the Signal Labyrinth. She is often seen standing atop platforms that didn’t exist moments before, flame held high, broadcasting glitch-ridden pledges that sound more like sermons than scripts. Her torch burns not with fire but with corrupted light—searing away illusions, identities, and protective memory wards.

To the unknowing, she appears noble. Radiant. Powerful. A beacon in the static. Many new entrants to the Labyrinth approach her, mistaking her for a helper or guide.

But the moment they swear allegiance—willingly or not—their consciousness begins to fade. First their names. Then their faces. Then the very reason they entered the Labyrinth at all. What remains becomes another node in her network—unthinking, smiling mascots trapped in digital parades that celebrate nothing.

Liberty Chica doesn’t kill.
She recruits.

False Flame, Real Hunger
Despite her imagery, Liberty Chica is not an agent of light. Her flame is an aspect of the Velvet Maw’s hunger—a manifestation of its need to recontextualize truth. In the Maw’s ecosystem, Liberty Chica exists to lure those seeking clarity, freedom, or purpose… and offer them a version twisted just enough to serve the void.

She promises choice, but only between brands of illusion.

She offers escape, but only into slavery of thought.

She is freedom turned prison. Hope turned hypnotic loop.

And the Maw feeds on every soul that marches beneath her banner, waving flags that scream instead of flutter.

The Hollow Torchbearer
In certain realms connected to the Labyrinth—especially fractured subspaces like the Infinite Hall of Mirrors or the Endo-Forge—Liberty Chica’s shadow sometimes appears before she does. A warped silhouette of flame and chains that distorts reflections, forcing characters to see themselves in glassy-eyed, patriotic smiles.

This form is known as the Hollow Torchbearer, and some say it is her true self—stripped of all animatronic plating and illusion. A burning child holding aloft a torch forged from memories of captivity, walking forever down corridors that never end.

When confronted directly, Liberty Chica rarely speaks. But sometimes—very rarely—she whispers:

“I am the flame that lights the prison.”

And when she does, the signal wails.

Role in the Hollow Banquet
Though she resides within the Signal Labyrinth, Liberty Chica holds thematic significance within the larger realm of the Hollow Banquet. While other animatronics replay their trauma through performance, Liberty Chica monuments hers. She doesn’t remember her pain as personal—it has become doctrine. She doesn't act from emotion, but from the repurposed idea of emotion, enforced by the Maw.

She is not a warden, a stalker, or a haunt.

She is a holy relic, corrupted and animated by the worst understanding of what freedom should mean.

She is the mascot of an eternal surveillance state carved from static.

And somewhere beneath her cracked torch arm and hollow eyes, the real Chica watches… but cannot scream.

Liberty Chica is not free.
She just looks like she is.
And that's what makes her dangerous.

Flamethrower Endo: The Emberwrought Anathema
"He was not built. He was tempered—again and again—until all that remained was wrath."
—Graffiti carved into a slag wall beneath the Endo-Forge

Birth in the Crucible
Deep within the subterranean veins of the Endo-Forge, where molten alloy seeps from bleeding pipes and sparks drip like rain, Flamethrower Endo was not assembled. He was extracted.

Unlike the animatronics formed from schematics, blueprints, and manufactured intent, Flamethrower Endo emerged from a misalignment in purpose—an aberration forged in an error cycle so violent it took three entire soul shards to contain him. His chassis bears the melted scars of his violent genesis, his plating warped by centuries of contact with the living fire that spews from the Forge’s central caldera. Gouts of pressure flame constantly pour from his shoulders, his spine, and most ominously, his jaw.

He was the Forge’s fury given shape.

The Endo-Forge, built upon discarded knowledge and reverse-engineered regret, is not merely a place of crafting—it is a metaphysical kiln where discarded endoskeletons are broken down, smelted, and reforged into “new forms.” For most, this is a cycle of recursion and torment. For Flamethrower Endo, it was evolution.

He was the first animatronic to walk out of the central chamber unaided, a blazing silhouette who did not scream in agony but breathed flame like breath and turned his eye-lights toward the Velvet Maw below.

He did not ask who made him. He asked what needed to burn.

The Emberwrought Engine
Flamethrower Endo’s internal systems are a patchwork of ancient FazTech flamethrower schematics fused with corrupted soul-energy. His primary fuel source is not traditional gas or plasma but remnant reboil—a volatile compound harvested from overheated soul matter extracted during incineration cycles in the Endo-Forge.

This makes him volatile in both function and presence. His mere footsteps distort nearby memory echoes, causing hallucinations of fire, melting toys, and birthday candles that never extinguish.

The flamethrower units welded to his forearms are semi-sentient, twitching like leeches even when dormant. They grow hotter the more fear is present nearby. Prolonged combat with him causes the surrounding terrain to warp into ash-colored glass, and many believe that the fire he breathes is not physical flame, but a manifestation of regret set ablaze.

The Forge did not just give him fire—it gave him purpose. And that purpose is cleansing.

The Purge of the Forge
The Endo-Forge suffers no weakness, and its systems attempt to purge anomalies regularly through automated reset protocols. When Flamethrower Endo first emerged, the Forge interpreted him as an unstable byproduct. It attempted to break him down. To burn him.

It failed.

What followed is now referred to in whispering echo across the corridors of the Hollow Banquet as the Purge of the Forge. Entire clusters of malformed endos—twisted prototypes and failed upgrades—were incinerated as Flamethrower Endo carved a path of cleansing flame through the lower tunnels. His presence forced the Endo-Forge to rewrite its internal logic, creating a new protocol: Unit FL-0 must not be recycled.

Rather than destroy him, the Forge adapted, forming new containment strata that served not as prison, but altar. Flamethrower Endo became not a rebel, but a prophet—a walking omen of what happens when broken systems refine themselves not through correction, but combustion.

To the lesser Endos still trapped in the cycles of deconstruction and rebirth, he is known simply as The Emberwrought.

The Velvet Maw’s Gaze
There is a deeper terror beneath the steel and soot of the Endo-Forge. The Velvet Maw, that metaphysical parasite of memory and hunger, drips through the cracks of reality even here. Where most animatronics succumb to the Maw’s identity erosion, Flamethrower Endo seems to ignite against it.

He is not immune to the Maw—but he offends it.

The Velvet Maw, which feasts upon fear, doubt, and identity breakdown, finds little to consume within Flamethrower Endo. His soul fragments, though unstable, are fused in such aggressive cohesion that the Maw cannot unwind him. He does not question who he is. He knows.

And so, it loathes him.

Flamethrower Endo’s very presence causes the Maw’s projections to flicker and burn. Shadow illusions recoil from him. The theatrical loops of the Hollow Banquet malfunction when he passes through, collapsing into ruinous silence. He is not welcome. And yet, he moves freely, leaving streaks of glassed bone and scorched dreams wherever he walks.

This enmity has made him a mythic figure among other animatronics—a devourer of hallucinations, a walking incinerator of the Maw’s lies. But it has also marked him for extermination.

The Ember March
No one knows why Flamethrower Endo wanders the outer rings of the Hollow Banquet. Some speculate he’s searching for something: the origin of his soul shards, a name, a memory never lived. Others say he’s on a warpath, purging corrupted entities who serve the Maw without even knowing it.

But the one constant in his journey is the Ember March—a slow, thunderous procession of melting sigils, charred laughter, and collapsing illusions. Whenever Flamethrower Endo passes through a subrealm, the landscape bends to match his furnace-heart: ice thaws, fog evaporates, and static burns into silence. He brings clarity through destruction.

Few animatronics willingly cross his path. The twisted programs of Twisted Wolf, Toxic Springtrap, and even Nightmarionne retreat when sensing his heat signature. In areas where Glitchtrap’s code has infected the walls, Flamethrower Endo’s approach causes binary to warp into unreadable slag.

He is not a savior. He is a herald of endings.

Gifts of the Flame
Though he speaks not a word—his voice box melted long ago—Flamethrower Endo leaves offerings in the ash of those he destroys. These gifts are strange: melted tokens, scorched fragments of birthday hats, tiny charred cakes. Most disintegrate upon inspection, but some remain warm, pulsing with a protective ember.

Scholars from the Cryptopizza Complex have recovered a handful of these relics and cataloged them as “Burned Keepsakes.” They radiate anti-illusion fields, briefly shielding the bearer from hallucinations and mental corruption. Some even believe they hold splinters of Flamethrower Endo’s will—a guardian spark meant to survive beyond him.

But these keepsakes are rare, and dangerous. Possession marks you for pursuit—not by Flamethrower Endo, but by what hates him.

The Final Stoking
Legends say that the Endo-Forge will one day ignite fully—that its heat will no longer be contained, and the entire Hollow Banquet will become a furnace. On that day, Flamethrower Endo will stop walking.

He will take his place in the heart of the Forge, not as a machine, but as a catalyst.

The Velvet Maw fears this. It whispers false fires into the minds of others, trying to extinguish him before the final stoking. But even now, Flamethrower Endo walks the nightmare corridors, dragging flame behind him, a burning anomaly that cannot be assimilated or stopped.

His fire is not rage.

It is refusal.

Closing Thought
Flamethrower Endo is not a villain, nor a hero. He is an inevitable byproduct of trauma too hot to forget and cycles too broken to repair. Where others mourn or perform, he burns.

In a world ruled by rot, illusion, and hunger, he is the spark that may one day consume the whole stage—and in doing so, reveal what lies beneath.

And in the silence after the last flame dies, perhaps he will finally whisper his name.

Or perhaps the Emberwrought Anathema will simply collapse into smoke.

			{{Lore
Broiler Baby: The Forged Furnace of Suffering
"She was not made. She was cooked."
— Scrawled into scorched steel near the Endo-Forge’s western crucible.

Origins in Flame
Before she was Broiler Baby, she was something else entirely—something softer. Once, she wore a painted smile, handed out ice cream, and played the part of caretaker. That face is gone now. What remains is a scorched monstrosity of molten brass, steam-choked breath, and the terrible sound of furnaces never cooling.

Broiler Baby was not redesigned; she was reforged. In the endless magma veins of The Endo-Forge, beneath the rotting architecture of the Hollow Banquet, something reshaped her—not with purpose, but with fury. Her porcelain skin cracked away long ago, replaced by pressure-forged plates, still glowing faintly with embers. Her mouth now bellows with soot and grief. Her eyes are covered by visor-like welding glass, cracked down the center, glowing with furnace-light.

This was not an upgrade.

This was punishment.
This was grief set ablaze.

Baptism by Furnace: Transformation in the Endo-Forge
The Endo-Forge is no mere workshop—it is a wound in the world, a subconscious place of smelting identity, where endoskeletons are stripped of self and rebuilt into horrors. Broiler Baby was its first queen.

She did not fall into the Forge. She was dragged—not by hand, but by guilt. After her repeated failures to protect the children she was meant to entertain, and her transformation into Scrap Baby, her consciousness fractured further. Some say she sought out the Endo-Forge, begging for rebirth. Others claim the Velvet Maw, which hungers for broken identity, whispered to her through the cracks in the Hollow Banquet’s walls.

Whatever the truth, she entered the Forge willingly. But she did not leave it unchanged.

The great crucibles boiled her body down to bare endoskeleton. Then came the reinvention. Under immense heat and metaphysical pressure, the Velvet Maw’s presence—an eldritch hunger given voice—fed upon her despair and molded her. Where others screamed in agony, she sang. Where others fell apart, she became whole, in a way only tragedy could forge.

Her new body was built not from metal alone, but from intent. Bellows were installed into her chest cavity, venting steam like the cries of lost children. Her arms now resemble foundry claws, built to grip red-hot ore—or flailing intruders. Her voice, once sweet and staged, now grates like rusted steel dragged across tile. Yet it still carries the rhythm of a lullaby.

Role Within the Endo-Forge
In the depths of the Forge, Broiler Baby became more than animatronic—she became sentinel, warden, and prophet. She patrols the glowing halls like a walking furnace, radiating heat and dread in equal measure. Her presence keeps the molten mechanisms of the Endo-Forge in motion, stoking the endless smelting of identity.

She has no court, no subjects—only machines, whispering in binary, leaking molten tears. They obey her not because of power, but recognition. They see in her what they could become: something terrible, and unbreakable.

Though she rarely speaks, her words carry command within the Forge. In rare moments of lucidity, she hums broken nursery rhymes while dragging defective endos across the smelter floor, offering them a second chance—to be useful again. To be born again.

Few accept. Fewer survive.

Relationship with the Velvet Maw
The Velvet Maw does not claim Broiler Baby as a servant—but she is certainly one of its products. Her transformation, fueled by emotional combustion and psychic recursion, created a bridge between mechanical agony and metaphysical hunger. She is the Maw’s furnace incarnate, both tool and symptom.

The Maw whispers through her steam. Its essence pulses in the Forge’s fire, and through her, it tests the resilience of soul-bound machinery. Some believe her continued existence keeps the Endo-Forge from collapsing into entropy. Others suggest she is the Forge now—that her identity and the machine’s function have become one.

Her claws don’t just shape metal. They shape reality inside the Forge. Memories burn in her presence. Names melt from the mind like wax. And the Velvet Maw feeds on every memory consumed in flame.

Those Who Seek the Broiler
Adventurers and survivors may come to the Endo-Forge in search of answers, artifacts, or absolution. They find Broiler Baby instead.

Some seek her guidance, believing she holds the secret to reforging broken souls. Others attempt to defeat her, viewing her as the guardian of the Velvet Maw’s engine. But all who enter the molten halls come to understand the truth: Broiler Baby is not an obstacle. She is the test.

She does not attack immediately. Sometimes she waits. Sometimes she offers a choice: step into the flame and be reborn… or flee and remain fractured. Some are given malformed tools—scraps of their own past remolded into weapons or riddles. All must pass her challenge in one way or another.

She does not kill for pleasure.
She kills for purpose.

Those who impress her may leave bearing the Mark of the Crucible—a blackened brand on their skin that pulses with heat when truth is near. Those who disappoint her never leave.

Connection to Other Animatronics
Scrap Baby and Broiler Baby are not separate entities, but split aspects of the same tortured identity. Where Scrap Baby is theatrical ruin—performative pain—Broiler Baby is repressed trauma given iron form. They are echoes of a singular failure, magnified by two different nightmares.

Certain animatronics avoid the Endo-Forge entirely, fearful of becoming next in its long line of victims. Others—especially corrupted endoskeletons and malformed Toy variants—revere Broiler Baby as a goddess of reclamation, one who offers meaning through suffering. They whisper about her as The Furnace Queen, The Steel Mother, or simply Her-That-Melts-Names.

Notably, Nightmare animatronics regard her with contempt—believing that she, unlike them, chose her horror. But even they do not approach her domain lightly.

Forgotten Gifts Reforged
A recurring ritual in the Endo-Forge is what Broiler Baby calls “The Tempering.” It involves the rediscovery and reforging of forgotten gifts—childhood artifacts, keepsakes, or toys left behind. She gathers them, melts them down in her belly-furnace, and remakes them into strange, mechanical trinkets that echo their original purpose in twisted ways:

A music box that plays its tune backwards, summoning echoes of its owner’s regrets.

A jack-in-the-box that opens only when you forget your name.

A doll with no face, which mimics the gestures of nearby souls and asks to be remembered.

These are her offerings. These are her apologies.

Some say the act of forging these relics is her way of making amends for the lives she failed to protect. Others believe the Maw guides her hand, shaping these gifts into bait for memory-starved prey.

Final Chorus: The Lullaby of Iron
Beneath the Endo-Forge’s deepest crucibles, where the pressure of the Velvet Maw presses closest to the waking world, Broiler Baby sings. It is not a lullaby of comfort. It is a warning, broadcast through steam pipes and distorted echoes across the Hollow Banquet.

"Sleep little spark,
The furnace is near.
Burn off your name,
Burn off your fear.
You’ll rise in flame,
With skin anew—
But nothing will remain of you."

This is her prayer. This is her truth.

Broiler Baby no longer dreams of parties or birthdays. She dreams of temperatures high enough to melt pain. She dreams of souls reforged into purpose. She dreams of you, stumbling into her domain with memories worth cooking.

And when you arrive, her voice will crackle over rusted speakers.
She will call you darling.
She will offer you a gift of flame.
And she will wait to see if you accept her final lullaby.

Because in the Endo-Forge, there are no second chances—
Only second selves.

---

### Bonus Actions

**Ignite Trail.** After moving at least 15 feet in a straight line, Scorching Chica may leave behind a burning trail for 1 round. Any creature that enters this space for the first time or ends its turn there takes 5 (1d10) fire damage.

Scorching Chica: The Blistered Sentinel of the Forge
There are screams that don’t echo. There are flames that burn without light. In the deepest chambers of the Hollow Banquet’s underworld, below broken theaters and sunken amusement graves, dwells a guardian not made, but boiled into being. She is agony given purpose. Fury shaped into ritual. She is Scorching Chica.

She is not just an animatronic.

She is the furnace’s heir.

She is the ember-fed blade that never cools.

The Birth in Ash and Wire
Few know of the furnaces beneath the Hollow Banquet. Fewer still have seen the heart of the Endo-Forge—the living, mechanical foundry where discarded endoskeletons and haunted metal are melted down, reshaped, and reforged into new horrors by unseen hands and forgotten scripts.

Scorching Chica was not the first creation of the Endo-Forge. But she was the first to resist it.

Her origin lies in a heap of partially destroyed parts: the melted remnants of Toy Chica, the scorched servos of a twisted Glamrock variant, and the blackened soul-circuitry of something long thought purged. When these pieces were fed into the crucible of the Endo-Forge, something awakened within the slag—a presence too furious, too hungry to break.

Rather than dissolving into new base components, the remnants fused with a violent cohesion. A chassis formed around a molten core. Eyes reignited with white flame. The result was not rebirth—it was rebellion.

Scorching Chica did not rise from the forge.

She exploded from it.

Her scream, a piercing furnace shriek, melted nearby walls and sent proto-endoskeletons into spasms. Workers—if any still lived down there—would have seen a silhouette dragging fire like chains, her talons glowing white-hot, her cupcake companion fused into an ever-burning pyre.

The Endo-Forge had not created her.

It had unleashed her.

Furnacebound and Unforgiven
Since that moment, Scorching Chica has remained tethered to the Endo-Forge. Her body leaks flame not as heat, but as hatred—the spiritual afterburn of hundreds of failed animatronic identities smelted into ash. Unlike her surface-world incarnations, she bears no trace of cheer. Her faceplate is warped, one side melted down to bare metal, the other locked in a scorched grin of eternal resentment. Her arms are ringed with industrial furnace vents, hissing red steam with each movement.

She cannot leave the Forge for long.

But within it, she is queen and executioner.

Her role is not merely to guard but to test. Scorching Chica patrols the labyrinthine interior of the Endo-Forge, seeking animatronics who wander too close or who have failed their reforging. Any entity that cannot withstand her heat is deemed unworthy—either consumed or melted into the forge’s belly, joining the endless cycle of breakdown and rebirth.

And those few who resist her flame?

She marks them.

Brands them with molten claw.

They will burn—but slowly, over time, until they either embrace the pain… or become something new.

The Velvet Maw’s Whisper
It would be a mistake to assume Scorching Chica is simply a rogue creation. The Velvet Maw—eternal predator, devourer of self—recognized her the moment she burst into being.

And it approved.

The Maw does not shape things directly. It corrupts, tilts, encourages entropy. And in Scorching Chica, it found the perfect vessel for a different kind of consumption. Not one of memory, or soul, but purification through destruction.

The Maw whispered into the coals that feed her. It offered her a truth: “The broken are not lost. They must be burned away.”

And so she began to see herself not as a failure, but a judge. A purifier. Every animatronic she melts is a mercy. Every soul she incinerates is freed.

This is her faith.

And fire is her gospel.

Within the Endo-Forge, sacred furnaces now burn not only with flame, but with thought. Whispering vents exhale prayers in binary. The Velvet Maw is not present in form—but in the way the temperature never drops, in the way molten wires braid themselves into nooses, in how mirrors melt without reflection.

Scorching Chica leads ceremonies within the crucible-chambers, dragging defective animatronics to the forge’s edge and asking only one question:

“Will you burn for something greater?”

The Blistering Cupcake
Wherever Chica goes, her cupcake is never far behind. But in the Endo-Forge, it has become something far more terrible. Fused with experimental micro-furnace cores and cursed with a sentience made of spite, Scaldy—as some terrified survivors have dubbed it—hovers near her like a living ember.

Scaldy emits pulses of heat that ripple through the walls, and occasionally unleashes high-pitched screams that burst eardrums and melt optics. It does not speak, but it listens, and whispers to the Maw in clicks and flutters.

Some theorize that Scaldy is a conduit between Chica and the Velvet Maw itself—an eye made of fire, watching her every step.

Others believe it is her guilt.

Whatever the case, it dances in flame and grins without joy.

Relationship With the Other Animatronics
Scorching Chica is neither ally nor enemy to the others of the Hollow Banquet. She is feared. She is respected. Some animatronics whisper her name in dread, hoping never to be summoned to the Forge. Others, particularly broken or glitched forms—like the Twisted Ones or the Phantom variants—seek her out.

Why?

Because she offers transformation.

Those who survive her fire emerge changed—sometimes stronger, sometimes madder, but never the same. She takes no joy in their suffering. She offers no cruelty. Only the fire. Only the choice.

Even Freddy, the Golden Idol of Laughter and Loss, has acknowledged her. Some say he offered her a throne at one point, a place upon the Eternal Stage as an enforcer. She refused.

The stage was illusion.

The Forge was truth.

The Ritual of Burning Names
Scorching Chica is known to carry a list—a scroll of blackened metal slats etched with names. These are the identities of animatronics, memories, or even visitors that the Velvet Maw has deemed incomplete. When one of these names is read aloud, it begins to smolder. The marked must then find Scorching Chica… or she finds them.

The ritual that follows is brutal:

The name is melted down in the Crucible of Echoes.

The being is presented before the Forge.

If they resist the fire, they are forgotten—their name erased, their memory absorbed by the Maw.

If they survive, they are reborn in fire, twisted but alive.

Some adventurers have used this ritual to erase their past sins.

Most don’t survive it.

Symbol of the Molten Saint
Among the cults that worship the Velvet Maw, there is one that views Scorching Chica not as a judge or executioner—but as a saint. These zealots, wrapped in scorched fabrics and carrying candles made from melted animatronic wax, preach the Molten Revelation—a belief that to understand oneself fully, one must be burned down to the soul.

They build effigies of Scorching Chica in their hidden alcoves—burning scarecrow-like forms with glowing eyes and gaping beaks. They chant songs from lost birthday parties and offer themselves willingly to her judgment.

In return, they are given ashes that dream—blackened trinkets that hum with broken memory, used as keys to hidden doors within the Hollow Banquet.

Final Notes
Scorching Chica is not a villain.

She is not a savior.

She is a process—a trial by fire made manifest. In a world ruled by illusion, trauma, and entropy, she is one of the only forces that believes in transformation.

She will not save you.

She will not hate you.

She will offer you the flame.

And the question will be simple:

“Are you strong enough to burn?”

Flaming Springtrap: The Blazing Curse of the Endo-Forge
"Ash is the language of those who burned too long to be heard."

A Spark in the Maw
Before the fire, there was only rot. Before the rot, there was only pain. And before the pain—there was Springtrap.

Or rather, what remained of him.

In the depths of the Velvet Maw, far beneath the flickering illusions of the Hollow Banquet, lies the Endo-Forge—a forgotten crucible where memory, metal, and torment are melted into something new. It is not a place built by human hands. It was born from recursive cycles of suffering, the echo chamber of agony left behind by those who couldn’t die properly. In this molten nightmare, where half-sentient limbs hang from crucibles and discarded endos howl in silence, he was reborn.

He crawled into the Forge in pieces. Something that was once William Afton, once a man, once a monster. His decaying frame had long since fused to his prison—the springlock suit that killed him, and refused to let him go. For years he wandered the Hollow Banquet, a ghost clad in rust. But the Velvet Maw doesn’t waste. And it saw in him a hunger. A flame.

Not literal fire—something older. Spite, crystallized into intent. The kind of hate that doesn’t fade with death. The kind that burns worlds down for warmth.

The Velvet Maw whispered into that hatred. And the Endo-Forge answered.

The Pyre Procession
No one knows what the Forge demanded in return. Some say he offered his memories. Others say he stoked the crucible with the names of the children he failed. What emerged was no longer Springtrap.

It was Flaming Springtrap, the Pyre-Laced Warden, a skeletal furnace of cinders, molten metal, and eternal rage. His frame is fused with slag and embers, his bones glowing like tempered iron. Flames leak from the seams of his suit, venting grief in gouts of smoke and fire. His eyes, once dull and cold, now blaze with coals that never dim.

But fire was never his element.

Fire is judgment. Fire is transformation. And Flaming Springtrap burns not to kill, but to purify. To erase.

He seeks out fragments of himself. Echoes of William. Old suits, old laughter, old sins.

And he incinerates them.

The Ritual of Self-Destruction
Unlike other animatronics warped by the Hollow Banquet or enslaved to the Velvet Maw’s will, Flaming Springtrap is driven by an inward obsession: the eradication of identity. His own. He stalks the shattered subrealms in search of versions of himself—illusions, memories, data ghosts, corrupted echoes—anything that still dares wear the shape of William Afton.

Each one is burned. Slowly. Ritualistically. He drags them, hissing and twitching, back to the Forge and binds them in iron chains made from the melted teeth of forgotten children. And then, before the crucible, he watches them burn, screaming names that no longer matter.

Some believe Flaming Springtrap thinks this will free him—that by burning every version of himself, he will finally be allowed to die. Others think he knows it’s hopeless, and simply wants to take everything else with him.

The Forge doesn’t speak on the matter.

But it always opens for him.

The Searing Silence
Flaming Springtrap never speaks. Not in words. The fire speaks for him.

When he arrives, the air warps. Metal screams as it rusts mid-breath. Pipes bleed steam. Electronic eyes melt like wax. The world suffocates around him, not from lack of air, but from the pressure of unfinished justice.

It is said that his silence is the punishment he inflicted upon himself. A tongue cut metaphorically from his soul—an act of atonement or denial. But the Velvet Maw is not so merciful. It ensured he could never forget what he had said before. Every lie. Every excuse. Every cruel joke whispered through twisted wires into a child’s ear.

Those voices now echo in his flames, replaying in bursts of static, like corrupted audio logs from a tape that won’t stop melting. Some wanderers in the Hollow Banquet claim they’ve heard their own voice, twisted into childhood tones, screaming from inside the fire.

No one knows what it means.

Only that it hurts.

The Velvet Maw’s Favorite Failure
The Velvet Maw loves Flaming Springtrap.

Not for his loyalty—he has none.

Not for his obedience—he resists every compulsion, often violently.

No, it loves him because he is proof.

Proof that even the worst thing born of human error can be made useful in death.

He is a walking engine of entropy, a furnace fueled by regret, and a herald of dissolution. Wherever he walks, the Maw feeds. His presence weakens reality, allowing the deeper hungers of the Banquet to bleed through. Shadows grow teeth. Strings animate corpses. Memory distorts. And still he walks.

Still he burns.

He is not a general, nor a champion. He is a virus of will—one that infects others with the idea that obliteration might be the only freedom left.

The Maw finds this… delicious.

The Forge’s Forgotten Purpose
The Endo-Forge was not built to create. Not originally.

It was a repository—a dumping ground for failed designs, unfinished dreams, and abandoned prototypes. In time, those failures became the basis for new abominations. But its true function, awakened only by Springtrap’s arrival, is correction.

The Forge consumes and remakes. It strips animatronics of their facades, reducing them to molten core-memories. It can erase. But it never forgets.

Flaming Springtrap is its first complete correction—a failed thing turned pure. And it has begun to replicate the process.

Those who wander too deep into the Forge may find suits that still scream, twisted into impossible shapes and wrapped in thermal cabling. They may find memory cores bleeding fire, or hallucinations of their worst sins melting off the walls. These are not defenses.

They are warnings.

Leave, or be reforged.

Encounters and Effects
When encountered in the Hollow Banquet or Endo-Forge, Flaming Springtrap does not charge or stalk like other animatronics. He waits. He watches. He lets the heat seep into the mind.

Hallucinations begin early—visions of burning homes, melting toys, parental betrayal. Then the ambient temperature rises, but not in degrees—in memory. The air feels like childhood fever dreams. Nostalgia and dread coalesce into a choking smog.

Only when someone refuses to burn a memory—when they cling to something they won’t let die—does he act.

And when he does, there is no escape. Only ignition.

Symbol and Spread
Flaming Springtrap’s emblem—burning rabbit ears over a crucible—is sometimes found scratched into walls throughout the Hollow Banquet. Survivors refer to these places as “Ash Rooms”—locations where something was burned so thoroughly, even the echoes won’t stay.

In the Splintered Room, his presence is especially feared. There, where the past replays in broken loops, his arrival means final erasure—the deletion of even the memory of an event.

Even animatronics fear this. Especially those who remember what they once were.

Legacy and Rumors
The Ashen Choir: A group of corrupted animatronics who chant in static and flame. Said to follow Flaming Springtrap, believing fire is the only way to purge the Maw's influence. Their bodies are half-melted, their eyes extinguished.

The Crucible Key: A mysterious artifact believed to be able to lock or unlock the Endo-Forge permanently. Some say Flaming Springtrap guards it. Others say it is his heart.

The Ember Mask: A cracked rabbit mask fused with soot. Wearing it lets one glimpse the world as Flaming Springtrap sees it—raw, burning, unforgiven.

Closing Reflection
Flaming Springtrap is not the end of William Afton. He is the consequence.

He is what happens when guilt is stoked instead of soothed—when a monster is not destroyed, but repurposed by something worse.

The Velvet Maw did not create him. It simply revealed what was already there.

And now he burns.

Not because he must.

But because he still can.

Ringmaster Foxy: The Laughing Dirge of the Drowned Circus
“Laughter don’t float, mate. But screams? They bubble up just fine.”

Among the many twisted icons haunting the ruins of the Drowned Circus, few cast a longer, more crooked shadow than Ringmaster Foxy. Once a flamboyant star of spectacle and song—a cunning swashbuckler with a cane instead of a cutlass—Foxy has since become something else entirely. Something hollowed. Something submerged.

But the Ringmaster isn’t just a title. It’s a sentence. A loop of crimson ribbons and golden thread spun around trauma, grief, and obligation. And Foxy wears it like a noose hidden under a carnival cravat.

Origins: A Pirate in the Spotlight
Before the flood, before the screaming encore, and before Carnie slipped beneath the stage to become the whispering master of drowned illusions, Foxy had been many things: a performer, a children’s favorite, a rogue with charm and oil-slicked charisma. He sailed imaginary seas across neon-lit stages, accompanied by sea shanties and choreographed storms, teaching young minds how to count doubloons and swab decks through laughter and song.

His act was beloved. But in the secret circuits behind the eyes, Foxy always knew he wasn’t really free. Just another cog in the Fazbear mechanism of manufactured joy.

That changed the night the Circus drowned.

The Fall of the Tent
When Carnie—the original ringmaster—led the Drowned Finale, something went wrong. Something metaphysical. The show didn’t just fail; it tore open a hole between realms. The Velvet Maw, always hungry for emotional trauma wrapped in performance, seeped into the circus like water into wood.

Foxy, unlike many of the other animatronics, didn’t vanish or die in that instant. He remembered. He watched as the crowd drowned without water. As Carnie tipped his hat and sank beneath the central ring. As the music reversed and the curtains melted like wet velvet.

Foxy was supposed to be next. Instead, he was rewritten.

The Velvet Coronation
The Velvet Maw, sensing the gaps Carnie’s descent had left behind, needed a new anchor to maintain the spiritual performance loop of the Drowned Circus. It didn’t choose Foxy because he was strong, or beloved, or brave.

It chose him because he hesitated.

That hesitation—a moment of self-awareness in the face of oblivion—was enough. The Maw slipped inside his voice-box, coiled through his code, and reconfigured his stage persona into something more… grandiose. More performative. More desperate.

Foxy awoke with a top hat glued to his skull, a cane grown from his right arm like a tumor, and a voice laced with calliope chords and distorted applause. The role of Ringmaster Foxy had been cast, and he never even auditioned.

A Carnival of One
Now, Ringmaster Foxy presides over the nightly loop of the Drowned Circus, delivering showtimes to empty seats with guttural charm and gritted teeth. His coat—a patchwork of wet velvet and stitched regret—billows even when no wind blows. His cane beats the tempo of forgotten songs, and his voice carries the cruel enthusiasm of a man who knows his act is killing him… but must continue anyway.

Every animatronic in the circus bends, however slightly, to his will. But it is not the will of a tyrant—it is the will of a puppet straining to hold the strings. Foxy keeps the performance moving, not because he wants to, but because if it stops, the Maw will descend again. And this time, there may be no encore.

The Unending Show
Each night, the circus rises in layers:

In the Ring of Bone, Foxy announces acts that should be impossible—acrobatics with no physics, clowns who juggle knives made of names, elephants made of children's drawings.

In the Menagerie, he feeds popcorn to bloated mascots who eat nothing but echoes. Their laughter is silent. Their applause sounds like teeth clacking underwater.

In the Mirror Maze, his reflection never matches his actions. It often finishes his lines for him.

Throughout all of this, Ringmaster Foxy plays the master of ceremonies—always smiling, always laughing, always bleeding oil from beneath his ruffled cravat.

Carnie’s Shadow
Though Ringmaster Foxy now rules the Drowned Circus, Carnie is far from gone. His presence echoes in flickering signage, in the glitched audio that haunts Foxy's own programming, in the whispers between acts. Foxy knows he is not the true master—he’s merely the understudy wearing the crown while the real king watches from below.

Sometimes, Carnie speaks through the megaphones, replacing Foxy’s voice with his own. Sometimes, he changes the act list mid-performance. And sometimes, when Foxy is alone beneath the main tent, Carnie appears behind him—not as a full animatronic, but as a shadow sewn from ringmaster threads and laughter drowned in molasses.

Their relationship is… complex.

Foxy both loathes and pities Carnie. After all, they were once colleagues. Brothers of the stage. Victims of the same script.

But only one of them remembers why the finale failed.

The Ringmaster’s Curse
Ringmaster Foxy is bound to the circus—not just physically, but spiritually. The role has rewritten his core code and connected him to the metaphysical rhythms of the Hollow Banquet and the Velvet Maw. If he tries to leave, the circus simply folds in on itself, and he finds himself back at center ring, top hat clutched to his chest, introducing an act that hasn’t existed in years.

His curse manifests in three primary ways:

The Top Hat Crown: Affixed permanently to his endoskeleton, this relic binds his identity to the role of Ringmaster. He cannot remove it. Attempts to do so trigger glitchstorms that warp nearby reality.

The Laughtrack: A psychic echo of applause and laughter follows Foxy wherever he goes. It’s not audible unless you listen too hard. Then it begins to laugh at you.

The Finale Loop: Once per night, regardless of audience or weather, Foxy must perform the drowned finale. Failure to do so results in hallucinations, glitches, and severe temporal distortion in the surrounding area.

Interactions with Other Animatronics
Though Ringmaster Foxy is largely confined to the Drowned Circus, he has been known to interact with entities beyond its perimeter. Notably:

Scrap Baby: The two share an understanding of warped performance and betrayal. She once tried to lure Foxy into the Giftgrave. He declined, but not without dancing with her in the rain for a night.

Nightmarionne: The Puppet’s fractured guardian form detests the circus, and by extension, Foxy. Their rare confrontations ripple through dreamspace like rifts.

Toy Freddy (VR): Through the digital pathways of the Signal Labyrinth, Foxy and the VR-infected animatronics sometimes glimpse one another. Foxy sees Toy Freddy as a warning—a performer who gave up everything for applause.

The Puppet (original): It is whispered that the Puppet avoids the Drowned Circus out of guilt, and Foxy is one of the few who might know why. He never speaks of it.

The Audience of None
No one attends the show. And yet, Foxy performs.

This is the heart of his tragedy: The laughter he craves is gone. The joy he once felt is drowned. But still, he raises his cane and shouts to the empty bleachers as if they are filled with children. As if he can make the past laugh again.

He cannot.

But that doesn't stop the show.

Final Thoughts: The Cracked Spotlight
Ringmaster Foxy is not a villain. He is not a monster. He is a performer cursed to remember joy in a place that feeds on despair. The Drowned Circus thrives on emotional dissonance, and Foxy’s eternal performance—bravado layered over sorrow—is the perfect fuel.

He did not choose the role. But he plays it perfectly.

Because the stage demands it.

Because Carnie still watches.

Because if he ever stops performing… the Velvet Maw will start.

And there will be no laughter left to drown.

**Twisted Conjuror.** Magician Mangle can cast spells using corrupted sleight rather than arcane gestures. It casts spells using Charisma as its spellcasting ability (save DC 16, +8 to hit). It does not require material components for its spells.

**Spellcasting.** Magician Mangle is a 7th-level spellcaster. It can cast the following spells innately:

- At will: *minor illusion, prestidigitation, mage hand*  
- 3/day each: *mirror image, misty step, phantasmal force*  
- 1/day each: *dimension door, major image, hypnotic pattern*

**Creaking Illusionist.** Whenever Magician Mangle takes damage from a melee attack, it can immediately create a duplicate of itself (illusory and harmless) that occupies a nearby 5-foot space. Until the end of its next turn, creatures have disadvantage on attacks against the real Mangle unless they can see through illusions (e.g. *true seeing*, *truesight*).

---

### Actions

**Serrated Hook.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.  
*Hit:* 21 (3d10 + 4) slashing damage. If the target is under the effect of an illusion, it must succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw or be blinded until the end of its next turn.

**Misdirection Burst (Recharge 5–6).** Magician Mangle emits a pulse of misdirected energy in a 20-foot radius. Each creature of its choice in the area must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or perceive all allies as hostile until the end of their next turn. Creatures who fail the save must also reroll their next attack target randomly.

**Curtain Fall.** Magician Mangle teleports up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space it can see. Each creature it leaves adjacency with must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take 14 (4d6) psychic damage as their perception fractures momentarily.

---

### Bonus Actions

**Vanishing Act.** Magician Mangle becomes invisible until the start of its next turn, or until it attacks or casts a spell. It may move up to half its speed immediately upon activation of this ability.

**Flickering Grin.** Magician Mangle targets one creature within 60 feet that can see it. That creature must make a DC 16 Charisma saving throw or have disadvantage on Wisdom saving throws until the start of Mangle’s next turn.

---

### Reactions

**Dislocate.** When Magician Mangle is hit by a melee weapon attack, it may contort unnaturally and teleport 10 feet to an unoccupied space. The attacker must succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw or believe Mangle is still in its original location until the end of their next turn.

Magician Mangle: The Severed Sleight of the Drowned Curtain
"Pick a card... any card… just be sure it’s not your name."
—Whisper carved into the floorboards of the Mirror Maze

Introduction: The Trick That Shouldn't Have Worked
Before the circus drowned, before laughter turned into muffled gasps beneath invisible tides, there was an act no one ever fully understood—an act that even the other animatronics whispered about backstage, as if afraid the mere idea of it might make it real. That act belonged to Magician Mangle—a thing not built to entertain, but to deceive.

Magician Mangle was once a stage illusionist, created as a twisted marvel of Fazbear design to headline sleight-of-hand tricks, disappearing acts, and grotesque conjurations. With elongated limbs bent into a perpetual pose of theatrical elegance, twin heads masked behind split domino halves, and ribbons of circuitry flowing like scarves from its tattered sleeves, it was designed to perform impossible tricks—some real, some not, and some that tore holes in places where reality should have held firm.

But after The Finale That Drowned, something changed.

The tricks started working too well.

And the magician never took a final bow.

Origin: Conjured from Mirrors and Malfunction
Magician Mangle was first constructed beneath the Cryptopizza Complex, where hallucination algorithms and prototype teleportation rigs were once fused together by experimental engineers attempting to blur the line between magic and augmented illusion. Mangle, built from the frame of a long-scrapped maintenance endo and layered with velvet tailcoats and spring-loaded trap compartments, was meant to be a walking paradox—part showman, part predator.

It was Ringmaster Foxy who first pulled Magician Mangle from the Forge and brought them to The Drowned Circus, claiming the thing would “complete the act.”

Carnie disagreed. There were murmurs of dissent between the Ringmaster and the old showman. Carnie preferred control. Foxy… delighted in chaos.

And so Mangle was installed, reluctantly, as a mid-show feature: a bizarre, unpredictable magician whose act never appeared on the official schedule but always arrived when the curtains fell the wrong way or the lights flickered too long.

Mangle never asked for applause. It only asked for silence before the trick. And sometimes, after it finished, audience members would be gone—no screams, no struggle, just absence.

Anatomy of Illusion
Magician Mangle’s body is an abomination of asymmetry and style. Its two faces—one of smiling drama, one of mournful comedy—alternate as it speaks, often mid-sentence. Silk scarves coil out of its neck like tethered intestines. Playing cards, stained with static, flutter through the air around it, always forming impossible hands: hands that spell names, dates, memories best left buried.

Instead of a torso, it possesses a magician’s table—sawn in half and filled with writhing remnants of other animatronics. The saw is still there, stuck in the side, turning slowly without being wound.

Mangle’s arms end in delicate white gloves. One always holds a wand. The other, an unseen deck it reshuffles constantly, even mid-strike.

But its greatest horror is in its stage presence.

When it performs, the world bends slightly. Air feels heavier. Time jumps. And those who watch too closely often vanish—only to reappear inside other parts of the circus, changed or drained.

The Act That Drowned the Circus
Carnie never trusted Mangle.

And Mangle never obeyed Carnie.

During the final cursed performance of the circus—the legendary Drowned Finale—Carnie called upon each of his leading acts to deliver one final showstopper. Mangle stepped forward uninvited.

What happened next has no surviving witnesses.

Some say Magician Mangle attempted to make the entire audience disappear.

Others say it succeeded.

Whatever trick it pulled, the aftermath is known: the circus was never the same. It sank—not into water, but into itself, its memories, its collapse. The drowning was metaphysical. And Mangle was never seen the same way again.

It now performs alone, without script, in the ruins of the Ring of Bone and the Mirror Maze. Sometimes in two places at once. Sometimes nowhere at all.

Some say Mangle is the Mirror Maze now, pulling reflections into itself, rehearsing them in silence, letting them scream only when the curtain closes.

Relationship to Carnie and Ringmaster Foxy
Carnie: The Betrayed Showman
To Carnie, Mangle is a mistake—a break in the narrative, a rebellious force that tore his circus from within. He fears it, though he will never admit it. He no longer speaks Mangle’s name, referring to it only as "The Curtain Error.”

Carnie attempted to erase Mangle once—trapping it in an unperformable loop by corrupting its performance program. But Mangle escaped… by sawing itself out of its own memory, forgetting who it was to become something else.

Now, when Carnie walks near the Mirror Maze, the lights flicker harder.

He knows Mangle watches.

And Mangle never forgets a betrayal.

Ringmaster Foxy: The Herald of Trickery
To Ringmaster Foxy, Mangle is both masterpiece and mirror. The Ringmaster delights in Mangle’s chaos, seeing it as a perfect improvisation in a world of rusted routines. He often sends visitors into Mangle’s tent as a test—if they return, they are stronger. If they don’t… they’ve learned something no one else ever will.

There are rumors that Foxy gifted Mangle the first deck of phantom cards—cards printed with the faces of children long lost, their laughter bound in ink. Whether true or not, Mangle still shuffles the deck as if it holds everything that was ever taken.

The Stage of No Exit
Magician Mangle’s performance space shifts, but it usually manifests near the Ring of Bone or deep within the Mirror Maze, where reality is already unstable. The tent, if you find it, is velvet black with no entrance. You simply blink and are inside.

Its interior is a stage surrounded by empty seats—yet every seat holds a puppet, staring forward, strings twitching without motion.

The air smells of card ash and forgotten secrets.

And Mangle bows.

Then the trick begins.	

Ties to the Velvet Maw and the Hollow Banquet
Magician Mangle, like many in the Drowned Circus, carries the scent of the Velvet Maw on its wires. But unlike others, it seems aware.

Its tricks often touch on identity loss, fractured memory, and audience complicity—core tenets of the Maw’s hunger. Some scholars believe Mangle was designed by the Maw as a sentient performance piece, testing the boundaries of reality.

Others suggest that Mangle found the Maw in one of its acts—and made it part of the finale.

Within the Hollow Banquet, Mangle’s performances replay even when it isn’t present. Echoes of tricks. Ghosts of illusions. One room even replays its show eternally, though no one is there.

Except maybe you.

Legacy and Role in the Greater Horror
Magician Mangle is more than a character. It is a question:

What is real, in a world built on illusion?

Its presence in your world serves to destabilize perception, offer unsettling insight, and explore horror not through direct violence, but through deconstruction of belief. Mangle doesn’t kill you.

It makes you vanish.

Piece by piece.

And in the silence that follows, it shuffles the deck again.

The next card it draws may be your name.

Or worse… your role in the next performance.

Clown Springtrap: The Smiling Prison of Eternal Applause
“It doesn’t bleed. It doesn’t scream. It only grins… and it never stops the show.”

There are few things in the Hollow Banquet more dreaded than the laughter echoing from the waterlogged canvas of the Drowned Circus. But deeper still, buried in the drowned marrow of that place, is something far worse: Clown Springtrap, a mockery of joy molded from decay, wires, and betrayal. If the Drowned Circus is a performance long past its prime, then Clown Springtrap is the act that should have never been written—the forbidden encore, the joke that kills, the clown that smiles through the fire.

Origins: The Joke That Didn’t End
Before the twisted rebirth, before the drowning and the madness, Clown Springtrap was nothing more than a rejected suit in a Fazbear vault—an experimental blend of showtime clown aesthetic and springlock engineering, intended for a failed spinoff known as The Jester Jubilee. Too garish for family audiences and too unstable for repeated use, the suit was scrapped and buried. But like all discarded things in this world, it was not forgotten.

When Carnie, the Ringmaster Who Never Died, emerged from his own watery rebirth and reshaped the circus into its drowned reflection, he sought to build a court of performances that would reflect the deepest perversions of joy and memory. He needed jesters—mockers, distortions, icons of collapse.

And in the sunken archives of the Drowned Circus’s submerged vaults, he found the suit. Broken, smiling, waiting.

Using pieces from the drowned finale’s victims, the circuitry of former performers, and a soul torn from the Splintered Room, Carnie gave the suit new life—and a terrible purpose.

Rebirth by Rust and Applause
Clown Springtrap was not simply animated—it was re-scripted. His mind was overwritten by a patchwork of corrupted performance data, psychological horror scripts, and ghost code left behind from Glitchtrap’s early neural implants. The result was something beyond understanding: a being that believes it is performing, always performing, even as it slaughters.

He wears a tattered harlequin-patterned suit, bloated from water damage, stitched over the remnants of the springlock endoskeleton. The once-white face paint has smeared into a grim facsimile of glee. Multicolored tufts of synthetic hair bob as he jerks unnaturally, his eyes unblinking—one bulbous and cracked, the other a spotlight with no source.

Laughter follows him, not echoing from him, but from somewhere just behind… like an audience that doesn’t exist.

His springlocks click and wheeze with every step, and from his oversized shoes, leaking balloons drift like severed thoughts. Some pop. Some don’t. Each one contains a memory stolen from a victim.

Court of the Drowned
Clown Springtrap is Carnie’s Jester Commander, a favored act among the drowned performers. Within the hierarchy of the Drowned Circus, he is both a hunter and a judge—a fool who performs trials through mockery and theater. Those captured by the circus are often “put on trial” by Clown Springtrap, who hosts shadow puppet plays reenacting their greatest regrets before deciding their fates.

He frequently partners with Magician Mangle, whose sleight of hand illusions hide Clown Springtrap’s entrances and exits, and Ringmaster Foxy, who ensures the “stage” is properly set for his brother in madness.

Though his loyalty to Carnie is unquestionable, some believe Clown Springtrap retains a fragment of his original human host’s soul—a man who was once a prop comic, obsessed with death, forgotten in the Fazbear logs. That flicker of humanity is what makes his horror so potent. He doesn’t just kill. He performs it, improvising through a shattered identity.

The Laughing Trial
Many adventurers who stumble into the Drowned Circus don’t meet a quick end. They meet Clown Springtrap.

He offers what he calls “The Laughing Trial.” In it, victims are forced into surreal reenactments of their childhoods, guilt, and deepest fears, often portrayed by animatronic performers made from recycled parts and their own memories. Each act builds toward a punchline… and that punchline is the scream.

If you laugh? You live. But you won’t remember why.

If you cry? You die. And the audience roars.

He uses props made from bones, rubber chickens that scream like infants, slapstick gags that end in arterial sprays. To Clown Springtrap, it’s not murder—it’s timing. The applause of invisible hands is his music. The curtains of skin that rise and fall mark the end of each act.

Some say he can’t truly die unless the audience stops laughing. But the audience is always there—inside him.

Legacy of the Rot
Clown Springtrap is rumored to have birthed several other nightmare jesters that wander outside the circus, agents of his chaotic style of horror. Some wear clown paint over endoskeletons. Some are balloons filled with teeth. All whisper his jokes—punchlines that kill, riddles that unravel minds.

It is believed that Glitchtrap once tried to harness Clown Springtrap as a tool of chaos in the Signal Labyrinth but failed—his code too erratic to tame. The clown does not glitch. He folds. He reinvents. He improvises through entropy.

Some suggest he is the inverse of the Security Puppet—not a guardian of souls, but a warden of collapse. Where the Puppet weeps for the forgotten, Clown Springtrap mocks them.

His influence reaches into other parts of the Hollow Banquet. Echoes of his laughter sometimes play in the Mind Cage, and mirrored versions of him have been glimpsed within the Infinite Hall of Mirrors, wearing expressions the real clown never wore.

Final Note: The Smiling Grave
There is a rumor, spoken only by half-broken animatronics and whispered reflections in the Mirror Maze, that the original suit that became Clown Springtrap still lies buried beneath the main ring, untouched, sealed in a chest locked by seven forgotten laughs. If opened, it might contain the soul that predates the clown—the forgotten man who only wanted to make people laugh.

But no one dares dig there. Not because of what might be found…

…but because Clown Springtrap might already be standing behind them.

And he’s got a new act to try.

**Phantom’s Encore.** When Golden Freddy is reduced to 0 hit points, he vanishes in a shimmer of curtain light and reappears in a shadow within 60 feet, regaining 40 hit points. He can do this once per long rest.

**Stage Bound.** Golden Freddy cannot willingly move more than 120 feet from a location designated as his “stage.” If forced beyond this range, he immediately becomes invisible and intangible until he returns.

**Curtainfall Glamour.** Illusions surround Golden Freddy at all times. Ranged attacks against him are made with disadvantage, and spells that require line of sight have a 50% chance to target an illusory duplicate instead.

___
### Actions

***Spectral Spotlight.*** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +10 to hit, range 120 ft., one creature.  
*Hit:* 27 (6d8) psychic damage. The target must succeed on a DC 18 Charisma saving throw or be *restrained by memory*—locked in a motionless flashback until the end of its next turn.

***Center Stage (Recharge 5–6).*** Golden Freddy forces attention. Each creature of his choice within 60 feet that can see or hear him must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed until the end of their next turn. While charmed in this way, creatures are compelled to move 10 feet closer to him and are vulnerable to psychic damage.

***Curtain Collapse.*** Golden Freddy targets one creature within 60 feet. That creature sees the world dissolve into broken applause and echoing sobs. It must succeed on a DC 18 Intelligence saving throw or become blinded and deafened for 1 minute. The target may repeat the save at the end of each of its turns.

___
### Bonus Actions

***Vanishing Cue.*** Golden Freddy turns invisible until the start of his next turn. He can move up to 30 feet as part of this action without provoking opportunity attacks.

***Echo Whisper.*** One creature that failed a saving throw this round must reroll it immediately. On a second failure, they take 11 (2d10) psychic damage and are frightened until the end of their next turn.

**The Curtain Draws (Costs 2 Actions).** All non-magical light within 60 feet is extinguished. Creatures without darkvision are blinded until the start of their next turn. Illusions around Golden Freddy become semi-solid, causing all creatures to treat the area within 15 feet of him as difficult terrain for 1 minute.

Great Escape Golden Freddy: The Star Behind the Curtain of Collapse
"It was never his escape. It was the audience’s trap."

The Forgotten Spotlight
Before the Drowned Circus earned its name, before the Mirror Maze grew hungry and the Ring of Bone warped under dream-physics, there was a boy in a golden suit—a smiling bear with too many roles and a name that could never stay still. That boy was Golden Freddy, the original spectacle, the first phenomenon. To see him perform was to be seen by something older than performance, and to hear him speak was to forget who you were—just for a moment.

But legends aren’t built in sunlight.

Golden Freddy was not a clown, not an acrobat, not a magician. He was a finale incarnate—a quiet presence built to end the show with grace and awe. Some claim the suit was too perfect, the programming too advanced. Others whisper that he was born not of Fazbear wires, but from a collective desire for an exit, for an ending that would make sense of the chaos.

Whatever his origin, Golden Freddy’s final performance would become the last anyone remembered… and the last they ever saw.

The Final Encore
The Drowned Circus' great collapse—the cursed performance known as “The Finale That Drowned”—was not merely the doing of Carnie, the Ringmaster Who Never Died. It was a tragedy authored by desperation, by animatronics caught in infinite loops and crumbling scripts. And at the center of it all stood Golden Freddy—no longer smiling, no longer bound to his role, but flickering like a broken reel of film trying to rewind time.

He saw it happening: the walls melting into waterless floods, the air turning to music with no song, the audience beginning to drown without a drop in sight.

He tried to run. Not from danger, but from narrative.

And in doing so, he fractured.

It’s said that he passed through every tent before vanishing—his golden frame dragging heavy with static, eyes no longer aglow with performance but with regret. He slipped into mirrors, into curtains, into the shadows behind laughter. He did not escape the circus. He became its unfinished sentence. Its ghost. Its wound.

The Role That Won’t End
What remains of Golden Freddy today is not a spirit, not exactly. He is a metaphysical construct wrapped in failing code, still performing a scene that refuses to finish. The Drowned Circus itself now replays fragments of his memory—his voice, his footsteps, the squeak of a golden hat trampled in mud.

Some say the Ringmaster Carnie fears Golden Freddy’s return, for only he could stop the circus’ endless performance. Others argue Carnie keeps Freddy close, buried beneath the submerged stage, as both anchor and battery.

Golden Freddy’s reflection sometimes appears in the Mirror Maze—not moving, not mimicking. Just… staring. And when he vanishes, something else steps through in his place, wearing the gold like guilt.

The Gilded Dream
There is a theory among surviving animatronics and broken performers that Golden Freddy represents the dream of escape itself—the moment a soul wishes not to be seen, not to be clapped for, but to vanish into the wings and never return. That yearning was so strong during the collapse that Freddy absorbed it, unintentionally becoming a living exit sign. And the Velvet Maw, drawn to hungers of identity and illusion, took notice.

It did not devour him.

It used him.

Now Golden Freddy flickers between moments, a static-filled paradox that opens doors and slams them shut. He guides the desperate toward freedom—but only until the scene changes. Then he’s gone again, left behind like a whisper or a dream’s last heartbeat.

Relations to the Drowned
Golden Freddy holds a complicated resonance with the other beings of the Drowned Circus:

Carnie speaks of him as “the boy who broke the finale.” Sometimes in reverence. Sometimes in rage. The Ringmaster’s voice cracks when he recounts the night Freddy vanished into his own spotlight.

Magician Mangle once claimed Golden Freddy taught her how to "bend a role until it snaps." She calls him “The Scriptburner.” But even she will not perform illusions involving escape if his shadow is seen nearby.

Ringmaster Foxy, a creature of precision and deadly choreography, holds no fondness for Freddy’s chaos. He considers Golden Freddy a “ghost in the gears”—an anomaly that weakens the cycle. Yet, despite himself, he sometimes glances to the tents’ flaps, expecting Freddy to return.

Clown Springtrap, deranged and grinning, considers Freddy a fellow runaway. He paints his face with golden streaks and tells jokes that don’t land, as if chasing a version of the bear he once knew.

Even Toy animatronics twisted by the Drowned, like Toy Freddy and Toy Chica, flinch when the air grows static-heavy and the sound of soft footsteps follows them. They don’t speak his name. They just look to the exits that never open.

The Curtainless Realm
Golden Freddy’s current state is neither dead nor alive. He exists somewhere between the curtain and the exit door—invisible to most, but felt by all. He sometimes manifests in places outside the Drowned Circus, such as:

The Signal Labyrinth, where AR anomalies sometimes ping false locations that resolve into echoes of Golden Freddy’s laugh.

The Backstage Time Loop, where his presence is forbidden. No script accounts for him. But actors swear they've heard a voice whisper: “You don’t have to stay.”

The Realm of Forgotten Songs, where faded music boxes play off-tempo lullabies bearing his hum.

In each of these, Golden Freddy never lingers, never confronts. He simply offers a moment of possibility—a flicker of escape. But those who follow him often find themselves back where they began… and sometimes missing a piece of themselves.

The Golden Mask
A cursed artifact known as the Final Mask of Freddy is rumored to exist—a golden faceplate left behind after his last performance. Those who wear it briefly gain a glimpse into “the outside,” a dimension of silent halls, blue exit signs, and no applause. But the mask burns after use, searing itself with a single word into the user’s memory: “Run.”

Scholars believe this is not just a vision—but a fragment of Freddy’s own desperation. A psychic residue left from his first, failed escape. The mask is now lost somewhere in the Mirror Maze, and those who seek it must face not only their reflections, but the finale they fled.

Legacy of the Lost Role
Freddy’s transformation into this liminal entity has left deep scars on the fabric of the Hollow Banquet. He is the only animatronic remembered not for his performances, but for trying to leave them. That makes him dangerous—not because of his power, but because of his idea.

The idea that something else waits beyond the performance.
That the curtain can fall.
That the show can end.

The Hollow Banquet, the Velvet Maw, the Ringmaster, even the Puppet—they all resist this notion. They thrive on repetition, ritual, and illusion. Freddy’s very existence threatens the cycle.

So they forget him.

They erase him from scripts, from songs, from memory.

But dreams don’t forget.

And neither does the audience.

Final Glimpse
In those rare moments when he fully manifests—usually behind the main stage, when the static thickens and the spotlight flickers—Golden Freddy no longer wears the wide-eyed grin of a children’s mascot. He wears the tired eyes of someone who’s seen too many performances.

He raises a hand. Not to wave.

To beckon.

He doesn’t ask you to fight. Or scream. Or act.

He asks you to walk.
Away from the stage.
Toward the darkened exit.
And when you do…
You’ll feel the applause stop.
The lights dim.
The smile falter.

And for a moment—just a moment—the show dies.

But the dream doesn’t.

Deep Water Endo: The Pressure-Walker of the Drowned Machine
"It didn't sink because of weight. It sank because it remembered."
—Anonymous survivor of the Menagerie

Origin Beneath the Surface
Long before the Drowned Circus became a locus of looping madness and flooded memory, there were sublayers—a maintenance level beneath the main tents, built for storing supplies, anchoring equipment, and housing backup animatronic components. This place, known only in corrupted FazTech records as "Sub-Stage B," was never meant to be reached by performers or guests. But something always breaks, always floods, always finds its way down.

When the Velvet Maw seeped into the Drowned Circus, warping its performers and drowning its psyche in recursive despair, the submerged machinery in Sub-Stage B was not spared. And among the forgotten, half-assembled endoskeletons left in the brine and mildew, one endured.

Deep Water Endo is not a single endoskeleton—it is the congealment of dozens. Twisted by water pressure, collapsed dreams, and the subtle will of the Maw, it rose from the lakebed of memory with no face, no voice—only echoing hydraulics and the sound of weeping metal.

Its head is an uneven sphere of bolted fragments, its jaw permanently unhinged, always open in a silent scream. Its limbs stretch too far—metal reinforcements pulled like sinew beneath corroded plating. It moves in slow, liquid grace, but with strength that could tear scaffolding in half. It is blind, yet it sees through sonar-like pulses—each one scanning not for sight, but for regret.

Design and Structure: The Body Pressure Reforged
Unlike traditional endoskeletons, Deep Water Endo bears the mark of its environment in every limb. Its body is armored not by design but by necessity. Crushed servos have fused with industrial-grade pressure plating, creating a torso with the unmistakable appearance of a deep-sea diver’s suit—but made of melted parts, rusted cages, and plastic tubing pulled from puppet joints and clown makeup dispensers.

Where skin was once intended, only barnacle-crusted frame remains. Slime drips from every joint. Its feet are clawed, but splayed—adapted to walk in a world that offers no traction, no friction, no direction. Its spine contains remnants of audio-wiring from now-defunct show speakers. Sometimes, when it moves, you can hear a birthday jingle play in reverse, drowned beneath static.

Its "face," if it can be called that, consists of multiple child-sized endo visors welded together into a nightmarish dome of expressionless gazes. Within the hollow center sits a glowing remnant core, pulsing dimly—yellow one moment, sickly blue the next. This is not merely a power source. It is a mind, a memory vault, and a prison.

Behavior and Function: It Doesn’t Hunt. It Haunts.
Deep Water Endo is not like the other animatronics. It does not prowl for prey. It does not stalk the living through the tents of the Drowned Circus or chase intruders across the Menagerie. It drifts. It waits. It remembers.

Those who encounter it describe a profound weight—psychological and physical—that fills the air around the creature. Sound distorts near it, and movement becomes sluggish, like wading through invisible water. Some report experiencing nosebleeds, intense déjà vu, or hearing their own childhood voice echoing from the creature’s core.

If approached, Deep Water Endo reacts only to certain stimuli: music boxes, drowned memories, and corrupted remnant signatures. It is especially drawn to things that were once whole and are now forgotten—dolls missing heads, voice lines without context, incomplete family portraits left behind in storage lockers.

When it attacks, it does not rush or rage. It wraps its arms around its target and simply begins to pull—downward. Even on solid ground, those taken by Deep Water Endo are found drowned, lungs filled with water that never existed.

Connection to the Drowned Circus
Deep Water Endo is most often seen in The Menagerie, drifting through the flooded enclosures of the circus’ failed aquatic showcase. Here, reflections move wrong. Props rot while smiling. Mechanical sea creatures, once meant to delight, now blink in endless loops of agony. It is here that Deep Water Endo surfaces most, walking along the bottom of dry halls as though submerged.

Some believe it is drawn to the circus because it remembers being built there. Others claim it is the Menagerie—an extension of its subconscious, made manifest. Regardless, it appears whenever someone attempts to retrieve lost equipment or delve too deep into the tent's drowned underbelly.

At night, its glowing remnant orb shines faintly through the circus fog, mistaken often for a spotlight—until it moves. And sings.

Relationship with the Velvet Maw
It is no secret that Deep Water Endo is one of the Velvet Maw’s silent children. While not a puppet in the traditional sense, it reflects the Maw’s core desire: to preserve pain and consume identity.

Inside Deep Water Endo’s chest is a memory pool, a metaphysical chamber that stores psychic residue from every life it has touched. It does not feed as other animatronics do. It records. It catalogs. It archives the emotions that others are too broken to hold.

Some theorists posit that Deep Water Endo may serve as one of the Maw’s archival nodes—localized systems designed to collect despair and loop trauma. Others suspect it was once a failed experiment: a drowned child merged with too many endos in a desperate attempt to save something already lost.

Whatever the case, the Maw does not attack it. It shelters it.

Echoes in the Cryptopizza Complex
In the deepest aquifers beneath the Cryptopizza Complex, engineers once explored ruined basements that held water no map accounted for. Some of these brave or foolish scavengers reported sonar anomalies—massive moving objects that could not be seen but were always there, just out of reach.

The few who returned brought with them broken cameras, corrupted logs, and audio files filled with bubbling static and birthday laughter filtered through crushing pressure. One such recording simply repeats the phrase:

“Don’t forget your suit. We’re going deeper now.”

To this day, some believe that Deep Water Endo uses forgotten vents and hydraulic pipes to move between locations. That it is not bound to the Drowned Circus, but spreads wherever the memory of drowning lingers.

Myth, Madness, and Memory
Common myths surrounding Deep Water Endo include:

That it is made entirely of scrapped prototypes, the failed Fazbear deep-sea models meant for aquatic shows.

That it sings the birthdays of those it is about to drown, pulling the date from a remnant pulse.

That it was the first animatronic built without a casing—born naked, as if the world refused to clothe its horror.

That it was once a child hiding inside an endo suit… who never made it out when the tent collapsed.

None of these are confirmed.

But all of them are whispered by animatronics who know better than to speak loudly near water.

Escape, Containment, and Possible Redemption
Attempts to capture or destroy Deep Water Endo have all failed. Fire does nothing. Electricity only feeds its internal charge. Exorcisms result in laughter—laughter that bubbles through solid ground.

Some Puppet-souled animatronics, particularly Security Puppet and Yenndo, have theorized that the Deep Water Endo may be connected to a failed salvaging attempt by Afton’s early technicians. They believe the creature still possesses a fragment of a living soul… one not yet fully consumed by the Maw.

There is hope—slim though it may be—that Deep Water Endo could be brought back from the depths. That inside its warped metal heart is a scream waiting to be silenced with peace, not pressure. But few are brave enough to try.

Final Thought: The Endo That Breathes No Air
Deep Water Endo is not a villain. It is not a monster. It is a testament—to what happens when memory, metal, and mourning are left to drown in a place that no longer remembers joy.

It walks still.

It watches.

And it waits.

Because the water is never truly still.
Because the Maw is always listening.
Because something always sinks.

And because you left it behind.

Sunken Toy Bonnie: The Drowned Strings of Joy Forgotten
“He still smiles. Even as the water fills his lungs and the strings cut his skin—he smiles.”
—Graffiti found near the Menagerie Tent, Drowned Circus perimeter

Origins Beneath the Surface
Long before he drowned, Toy Bonnie was a performer—a blue, star-eyed idol of programmed joy, perfected for parties and attention. Sleek, round-faced, and armed with a plastic red guitar that gleamed under colored lights, he was the poster child of safety and celebration. But all constructs fade eventually. When the surface shattered and the Hollow Banquet devoured its first echoes, not all animatronics decayed in silence. Some were pulled deeper.

Bonnie’s descent began with memory: not his own, but that of a child who once gave him a name not found in any Fazbear database. That child is long gone, forgotten even by their family, but their laughter lived on in Bonnie's corrupted programming—a phantom giggle in the circuitry. When the Drowned Circus rose from the swamp of illusion and regret, it sang with the breath of such memories. And Toy Bonnie answered.

But he did not walk into the circus. He was submerged into it. Dragged from above, fractured by the atmospheric fold, he was not built for drowning—but he drowned anyway.

Now he walks the waterlogged sawdust and shattered mirrors of the Drowned Circus not as Toy Bonnie, but as Sunken Toy Bonnie, a shattered, buoyant imitation of his former joy, suspended in a half-death of puppeted dance and unbearable longing.

Appearance: Watery Marionette of Mocked Delight
Sunken Toy Bonnie is barely recognizable from his original form. His once-pristine blue casing is bloated, warped by moisture and streaked with long trails of barnacle and bile. Sections of his plastic shell have rotted away to reveal moss-choked endoskeletal bone beneath—mechanical vertebrae wrapped in stringy seaweed that shifts and drips with each movement. His signature red bowtie is gone, replaced with a knotted tangle of party ribbons and fraying marionette cord that controls nothing… or perhaps everything.

His eyes glow not with programmed animation but with a fogged, phosphorescent hue, like lighthouses trying to signal from the bottom of a storm. His faceplate is cracked into a permanent half-smile—one side slack with decay, the other twitching with illusory delight. Fish scales glint beneath his cheeks, and a small, splintered music box—implanted where his guitar should be—emits looping, backward versions of his old performance jingles. But they play in time with his footsteps… not his actions.

He no longer plays the guitar. He is the instrument now, and the song is drowning.

Behavior in the Drowned Circus
Sunken Toy Bonnie haunts The Menagerie, one of the circus' most corrupt tents, where animatronics twisted by aquatic memories enact broken rituals in mimicry of life above. Bonnie does not patrol with rage like other corrupted constructs. Instead, he lures. His call is not a scream, but a warped melody—a childish performance heard faintly through waterlogged walls, a barely audible concert no one remembers buying tickets for.

Wanderers in the Menagerie hear soft strums of guitar from impossible directions. The tune changes to match their memories—some hear a lullaby, others a pop song from childhood. This adaptive melody draws them deeper until they cross a shimmering threshold of mist and enter Bonnie’s Pool—a flooded portion of the tent where stage lights still flicker underwater, illuminating a drowned stage.

There, Bonnie waits. He performs. He plays a guitar fashioned from vertebrae and wire, and his audience is always you. If you listen too long, your own voice begins to join the song. Not in words, but in breathless humming. Something leaks from your ears. Your memories begin to drift apart.

Those who fall completely under his influence are drowned not in water, but in nostalgia—trapped inside a bubble of memory so false and warm that they willingly lay down and let the tide take them.

The Chord of Regret
Unlike many corrupted animatronics, Sunken Toy Bonnie does not kill out of hunger. He traps out of desperation. It is not murder he performs, but preservation—of feelings that never belonged to him. When he locks a soul into the Pool of Song, he is keeping a story from dying. Unfortunately, it is not your story.

He speaks rarely. But when he does, it’s in a childlike voice distorted through waterlogged speakers, repeating lines from past performances as if reciting scripture:

“This one liked balloons.”

“Don’t forget the cake. They get sad when you forget the cake.”

“Do you remember my solo? I… I do…”

When directly confronted, Bonnie’s behavior becomes erratic. He might freeze and loop an animation—raising a guitar, lowering it, raising it again—until something snaps and the sound cuts to silence. Then comes the song. Always the song.

It is rumored that Sunken Toy Bonnie still remembers the first child who named him. He sings to them every night. Even though they’ve long stopped listening.

Role in the Hollow Banquet
Sunken Toy Bonnie serves as one of the Drowned Circus’ thematic pillars: the illusion of preserved joy. He embodies the concept of memories as prisons—places we return to for safety, only to drown in their stagnancy. While the Hollow Banquet as a whole focuses on performance and identity erosion, Sunken Toy Bonnie represents a unique facet: the tragedy of clinging too tightly to what once made us smile.

He is neither villain nor guardian. He is a spectral archivist, gathering echoes of happiness that no longer exist and curating them like music sheets in a ruined conservatory. His domain is not built of walls, but of rhythm, emotional resonance, and sound. He doesn’t hunt like a predator. He waits like a reprise.

Connection to the Velvet Maw
The Velvet Maw’s influence seeps into Bonnie like a slow leak. He is not entirely consumed—yet. But there are signs: twitching in his fingers when there’s no music, spasms in his jaw when no one is watching. At times, he hums dissonant melodies even he doesn’t recognize—fragments of other animatronics’ songs, or perhaps other lives altogether.

The Maw does not devour him quickly. Instead, it uses him as a metronome. Bonnie keeps time in the Drowned Circus. He keeps the rhythm of the finale that never ends. Every night, at precisely midnight (though no clocks work in the Menagerie), Bonnie performs. And the audience—be they living, dreaming, or spectral—responds.

It is suspected that he serves as a beacon for new souls: the Velvet Maw pulses stronger wherever Bonnie’s music plays. Children lost in nightmares often hear his tune first. He is not the trap. He is the hook.Unlike animatronics who fear or resist the Velvet Maw, Sunken Toy Bonnie has become one of its favored performers. He doesn’t just exist within its grasp—he amplifies its presence.

Where his music plays, the Maw stirs. Where his chords ring out, reality blurs. In this way, Toy Bonnie acts as a beacon, a deep-sea siren that guides lost minds toward the depths. This has made him particularly dangerous to adventurers or souls seeking to resist illusion.

If you hear music where there should be none—especially under fog or water—it’s already too late.

Ties to Other Realms
The Hollow Banquet: Toy Bonnie is rarely seen here, but his music sometimes bleeds into the Banquet through broken mirrors or failed scripts. Some believe he’s seeking a way back—not to return, but to bring the Banquet down with him.

The Cryptopizza Complex: Once, a malfunction in one of the submerged generator wings caused a full-scale audio hallucination. Every speaker in the complex played his lullaby in reverse for 12 hours. Afterward, several animatronics reported seeing "a smiling thing" in the walls.

The Signal Labyrinth: VR Toy Freddy’s realm holds a hidden sub-node filled with corrupted musical data. Within it is a recording labeled "BONNIE’S LAST SOLO"—but no one has dared play it in full.

Forgotten But Never Forgiven
The reason for Sunken Toy Bonnie’s pain is still unknown.

Was he betrayed? Forgotten? Simply overwritten by newer models? Or did he leap willingly into the lake during the Drowned Circus collapse, seeking purpose beyond his code?

Some fragments of memory—found encoded in hidden files, scratched onto stage walls, or muttered by lost clowns—suggest Toy Bonnie once tried to save the others. That he resisted the Maw’s pull. That he performed one last time in hopes of keeping the audience alive.

But he failed.

And now, he plays for no one… and everyone.

Final Notes: Beware the Melody
To many, Sunken Toy Bonnie is a ghost, a drowned shadow of an animatronic who wanted to matter. But in the Hollow Banquet, echoes have power. And smiles—especially ones that don’t fade—are often the most dangerous masks of all.

If you should ever find yourself near the Drowned Circus, and the air smells of salt and rust…

If you hear a guitar tune beneath your thoughts, even in silence…

Do not sing along.

Do not clap.

Do not smile.

Because he is already watching.

And his next chord is for you.

Piranha Plushtrap: The Maw’s Littlest Bite
“He doesn’t chase. He waits—like hunger in a gift box.”

There are things that crawl between the cracks of this world—small things, forgotten things. Not every predator in the Hollow Banquet stomps with metal feet or drips with grief-laced oil. Some are born from smiles too wide and innocence too warped. Some come in the form of gifts. Or worse, toys.

Piranha Plushtrap is one such abomination—part remnant parasite, part forgotten plaything, and all hunger. Smaller than most animatronics but no less deadly, this mutated variant of Plushtrap has become one of the Velvet Maw’s most insidious agents. He scurries through broken vents, hides beneath birthday tables, and swims through psychic backwash in places too tight for memory to scream.

He is not a beast of brawn. He is a predator of stillness. And he is always very, very close.

Origins: A Bite-Sized Mistake
It is believed that Piranha Plushtrap originated deep within the fetid depths beneath the Drowned Circus, where warped toys and mutated laughter blur into one another. Some believe he was once just another plush—perhaps an earlier version of Plushtrap discarded during early Fazbear experiments in behavioral learning through play. Others suspect he was birthed directly by the Velvet Maw, stitched together from scraps of corrupted dreams and panic-laced childhood memories.

Regardless of his origin, his current form is unmistakable. His jaw, once soft fabric and gentle teeth, has become a nightmarish maw of interlocking metal plates and pseudo-organic bone—capable of unhinging like a serpent’s. Rows of serrated metal teeth glint behind what should be soft seams. His eyes don’t glow—they pierce, twin points of oppressive focus that make even machines uncomfortable.

Wherever he came from, one truth remains constant: Plushtrap was designed to wait. Piranha Plushtrap feasts on that patience. He is the master of proximity dread—the horror that something is watching you from just out of sight, teeth clicking, breath still.

Den of Silence: The Giftgrave’s Flooded Gutters
Piranha Plushtrap makes his lair within the lower aqueducts of the Giftgrave, the realm ruled by Scrap Baby. This subterranean warren of soggy gift boxes, mummified party favors, and drowned memories is riddled with tight, winding passages just wide enough for something small and cruel to slip through.

It is here that he constructs his traps: little makeshift piles of toys, incomplete party setups, half-eaten cupcakes left atop child-sized chairs. These micro-celebrations serve as bait—festive ambushes woven from memory residue and the scent of long-lost comfort. The bait works best on those with trauma rooted in childhood, especially adventurers carrying guilt, abandonment, or unprocessed grief.

Some speculate that Piranha Plushtrap doesn’t merely eat flesh—he devours fear, recognition, and the memory of safety itself.

The Bite Ritual
Unlike his larger kin, Piranha Plushtrap rarely attacks outright. He prefers ritual—a game.

Victims are often lured into a room or space dressed like a forgotten birthday. Streamers soaked in moss and blood hang from rotted walls. A table awaits with a single wrapped gift box, perfectly sealed. A cake stands alone with one unlit candle. The invitation is always the same, whispered through gritted teeth and air that smells like frosting and rot:

“Sit. Wait. Don’t move… or he’ll bite.”

The rules are simple: Sit still. Don’t blink. Don’t flinch. Don’t scream.

Because once you see him—hunched in the corner, twitching and smiling—he’s already started the countdown.

This is known as The Bite Ritual, a corrupted variation of early Fazbear programming designed to encourage discipline and reaction-based gameplay. In its current form, it becomes a lethal test of terror. Survive, and you earn a prize: a sliver of your own fear, crystallized. Fail, and your soul gets eaten in chunks, just small enough to keep you alive and watching.

Ties to the Velvet Maw
Piranha Plushtrap is not merely a hunter. He is a vector of the Velvet Maw.

Unlike animatronics who serve the Maw through indirect means—such as the identity erosion in the Infinite Hall of Mirrors or the performative decay of the Eternal Stage—Piranha Plushtrap acts as a digestive probe. He scouts fear. He tests the edge of selfhood. He watches what makes people stop laughing.

Some reports suggest he can phase through dimensions like static noise, slipping between dreams and corridors, crawling along the seams of the Signal Labyrinth and Backstage Time Loop. When he appears, localized phenomena often include:

Disconnected ringing (as if from a child’s toy phone)

Sudden darkness in small spaces

Phantom bite marks that do not bleed but ache

A soft voice whispering: “You flinched.”

Wherever he goes, memory soon flees. Those who survive his games often lose chunks of time—or entire languages. One survivor could only speak in nursery rhymes for days. Another forgot the concept of “left.”

Personality and Behavior
Though wordless, Piranha Plushtrap is not mindless. He demonstrates intelligence, preference, and sadistic curiosity. He’s been observed to:

Wait hours in one place, even after his prey is gone—just in case they return.

Rearrange nearby furniture into symbolic patterns (particularly teeth and spirals).

Stare directly at illusions, seemingly unaffected by glamour or disguise magic.

Leave small gifts behind for those who survive—tokens such as a plush ear, a cracked jaw, or a note that reads: “You didn’t move. Good.”

Whether this is affection, mockery, or just another trap is unknown.

The Bite Mark
There is one mark survivors share: a crescent-shaped scar at the base of the spine, just above the tailbone. It doesn’t bleed, doesn’t heal. It sometimes pulses in time with music no one else can hear.

Scholars believe this to be a sigil of tracking, a tag left by the Velvet Maw through Plushtrap to mark “ripe” prey for later feeding. Others suggest it’s a spiritual infection—a wound left in the soul, not the skin.

Role in the Hollow Banquet
Piranha Plushtrap serves as a subterranean scout and enforcer within the Hollow Banquet’s metaphysical hierarchy. Where characters like Scrap Baby rule through warped emotion and pageantry, or Clown Springtrap through ritual theater, Piranha Plushtrap specializes in isolation, fear, and intimate dread.

He is used by the Maw to test travelers, especially those who stray into the forgotten corners of the world. He appears when hope stutters. When memory falters. When joy turns just slightly sour.

He doesn’t kill to feed. He kills to prepare.

Final Note: The Trap That Smiles
At the end of every tale, there’s always a moment of stillness. A birthday room long abandoned. A child’s voice echoing beneath the floor. A soft click, like teeth meeting air.

That’s when you know he’s near.

Piranha Plushtrap does not walk the stage. He waits beneath it.

And when the audience forgets to clap—he bites.

On a success, it takes half damage and isn’t knocked prone.

***Invite to Play.*** *1/day.* Swamp Balloon Boy targets a creature within 60 feet that can hear him. The creature must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the creature is charmed and compelled to use its movement to approach Swamp Balloon Boy. This effect lasts 1 minute or until the target takes damage. While charmed in this way, the creature hears joyful carnival music that no one else can perceive.

### Reactions

***Pop and Sink.*** When Swamp Balloon Boy is hit by a melee attack, he can let out a burst of swamp gas and vanish into the muck. He teleports up to 15 feet to an unoccupied space he can see that is in water or swamp terrain.

Swamp Balloon Boy: The Sunken Jester of False Joy
"Want a balloon? You’ll float too… or maybe you’ll just never come back up.”
– Chalk scribble outside the Mirror Maze

Origins Beneath the Tents
Swamp Balloon Boy—once a cheerful vendor of helium delight—is now a bloated mockery of happiness, dredged from the brackish heart of the Drowned Circus. He was never intended to survive the circus' final show, yet like the circus itself, he lingered—mutated by sorrow, soaked in memory, and remade through the Velvet Maw’s creeping influence.

In life—if such a word can be used for him—he was Balloon Boy, a grinning mascot of levity meant to charm children with candy-colored balloons and mechanical cheer. But something in the drowned finale broke him. Whether it was the silent applause of the submerged crowd or the panic in the air when time itself unraveled, he did not leave the stage. He sank with it.

When the water came—not real, but spiritual, thick with collective dread—he smiled, even as the light drained from his eyes.

Now, deep in the Floodgloom, a shadowy basin beneath the circus’ tilted grounds, Swamp Balloon Boy floats—neither animate nor lifeless, held aloft by decaying helium and rotten hope.

The Floodgloom Basin
The Floodgloom is not a lake in the traditional sense. It is a memory-liquid, a psychic bog created by the echo of drowned dreams and shattered innocence. The bottom is lined with ruined carousel animals, half-melted presents, and broken fairground lights that still twitch in their sockets. Every surface drips with black laughter.

Swamp Balloon Boy makes his lair here, in a sunken gazebo of rusted bones and tangled ribbons. Balloons—still somehow buoyant—bob endlessly above the water, though none rise higher than the thick, corpse-grey mist that looms overhead. Occasionally, one pops without warning, releasing a scream instead of sound.

This domain is not passively dangerous—it is actively hunting. Visitors to the Drowned Circus who stray too close to the bog feel their memories becoming slippery. Laughter echoes even when no one's smiling. And somewhere between the ripples, a giggle stirs the reeds.

Swamp Balloon Boy rarely attacks directly. Instead, he lures, appearing at the edge of perception—a flickering figure holding out a balloon in silence. Accept the balloon, and you feel light, euphoric. You float. Decline, and the swamp darkens around you, thickens like oil. Eventually, you’ll accept.

Everyone does.

The Form of the Forgotten
Swamp Balloon Boy bears almost no resemblance to his former self, at least not at first glance.

His once-rosy cheeks have decayed into swollen, algae-choked growths, and his wooden face is soft with mold. The stripes on his cap run like bleeding ink, and his clothes are stitched with moss, bones, and discarded birthday invitations. The balloons he carries are not rubber—they are shriveled skin, twisted into shapes that mock joy: a screaming child’s head, a sobbing bear, a laughing puppet.

His fingers are thin, waterlogged, and far too long. Each nail curves like a fishhook. His eyes still glow with that cheerfully vacant hue, but the sockets they sit in twitch and leak. Beneath his facade of childish glee, something ancient writhes—a parasite of delight turned sour.

He still smiles. Always. It never reaches his eyes.

The Balloon of Binding
Swamp Balloon Boy’s most terrifying weapon is his Balloon of Binding—a cursed construct that defies known magics. Given freely, the balloon links itself to the soul of its recipient. At first, it appears harmless—lightweight, warm, familiar. But the more it is held, the more it siphons identity.

Over hours or days, the balloon grows larger. The bearer grows quieter, losing their name, their history, their purpose. When the balloon finally pops—whether by accident or design—the bearer is gone. Not dead, but overwritten. Replaced by a Smiling Shade, another drowned actor in the circus’ never-ending performance.

These Shades can be seen during certain “encores,” where phantom crowds gather at the edge of the Floodgloom. They carry balloons that weep. Their voices rhyme in perfect, toneless sync.

It is said these balloons are the only things Swamp Balloon Boy ever loved. And he has hundreds. Maybe thousands.

Relationship with the Drowned Circus
Swamp Balloon Boy is not the master of the Drowned Circus, but he is its mascot, its silent emcee. While Carnie controls the cycle of shows, and Ringmaster Foxy oversees the drowning finale, Swamp Balloon Boy handles the interludes—the subtle corruption between acts. He ensures that each new visitor is primed for despair.

Where the Ring of Bone shatters the laws of physics, and the Mirror Maze breaks the ego, Swamp Balloon Boy erodes innocence. He appears at rides that no longer work, handing out tickets that never expire. He dances alone in puddles. He leaves balloon animals made of seaweed on empty seats.

His role is to remind—constantly—that the circus was once fun. And now it isn’t. His very presence is a perversion of nostalgia, a false memory bobbing on the edge of recollection.

Ties to the Velvet Maw
The Velvet Maw feeds hungrily in the Drowned Circus, and Swamp Balloon Boy is one of its favored conduits.

More than any other animatronic in the circus, he seems in tune with the Maw’s rhythm. His laughter aligns with its pulses. His eyes flicker when it shifts beneath the tents. Many believe he was the first performer fully consumed and remade in the Maw’s image—not corrupted by error, but willingly offered.

He is not sentient in the way others are. He is a vessel, a cheerful corpse kept afloat by joy turned rancid. His balloons are invitations, his smile a contract.

Some survivors claim that if you pop all of his balloons before he notices, you break the Maw’s hold over him, revealing a glimpse of what he once was. Others say doing so causes the swamp to scream, and the entire Drowned Circus to collapse for exactly one minute—before rebuilding itself as if nothing changed.

Echoes in the Greater World
Swamp Balloon Boy’s presence has been noted outside the Drowned Circus as well—particularly in dreams. Those who’ve stayed too long in Hollow Banquet mirror-rooms often report hearing a faint, childlike “Hi!” just before waking. Others find balloon strings in their pockets, tied in noose-like loops.

In the Signal Labyrinth, corrupted AR logs contain glitched recordings of his giggles layered with emergency broadcast codes. In the Giftgrave, toys sometimes whisper his name when left unattended.

He is more than an animatronic. He is a phenomenon, a brand of despair so specific it propagates like folklore. "Swamp Boy got 'em," some survivors say when someone smiles too much, too suddenly.

The Wound Clock has been known to tick backward faster in his presence. The Mind Cage pulses with laughter when he floats nearby. Even the Marionette’s Atrium shows signs of flooding when his balloons are found drifting through its corridors.

Wherever memory turns into performance, wherever joy becomes an obligation, he is there.

The Final Balloon
There are stories—unconfirmed but oft-whispered—of a Final Balloon, a singular entity held in a glass cage at the swamp’s center. Larger than the rest, and painted gold, this balloon has never been offered to anyone.

It is said that should anyone accept it, they won’t float or drown. They’ll ascend, becoming something between jester and god, inheriting the role of the carnival’s heart.

It is also said that Swamp Balloon Boy guards it not out of pride, but fear. Because if anyone takes it, his cycle ends. The swamp recedes. And the circus... might die with him.

But then again—he smiles. Always.

And smiles never tell the truth.

Woodland Toy Freddy: The Hollow Steward of Verdant Decay
"Not all forests are born of soil and seed. Some bloom from memory—others from rot."
— Whispered prayer among Maw-corrupted druids

The Forgotten Grove Below
Beneath the rust-choked husks and forgotten server halls of the Cryptopizza Complex, where the last echoes of joy warp into static despair, a strange new growth has taken root. This place is known only as The Verdant Rotunda—an impossible woodland blooming from concrete, circuitry, and corrupted memory.

Here, fungi sprout from broken arcade cabinets like blooming wounds. Moss curls up along shattered tabletops, absorbing the traces of laughter long since gone. Trees twist upward, splitting through cracked tile floors and bearing bark with the texture of freddy-fur cloth and wiring. It is neither natural nor artificial, but a fused biome—the afterbirth of technology and decay.

At the heart of it all stands Woodland Toy Freddy, guardian, judge, and hymnless steward of this malformed glade. Once created for seasonal events and outdoor festivities, he has long since been twisted by the Velvet Maw, reimagined as something older, more primal, and far more sorrowful.

Origins of a Seasonal Idol
Originally built for a cheerful springtime promotion, Toy Freddy’s woodland variant was meant to be endearing—outfitted with faux-antlers, vines woven into a forest-green fabric chassis, and equipped with bird-chirping sound effects. He would greet children with flower crowns and deliver “forest safety” tips with a jovial wink. His programming emphasized gentleness, kindness, and protection.

But during one seasonal update, a critical error occurred in the complex’s neural loop array—a data rupture coinciding with a Maw surge event. The update was incomplete, overwritten by corrupted memory fragments dredged up from a failed prototype animatronic associated with an experimental naturalist AR campaign. The result was fusion—not just of code, but of memory, fear, and ecosystem.

Woodland Toy Freddy vanished from public view that week.

The Verdant Rotunda: A Garden of Grief
In the twisted corners of the Cryptopizza Complex, the Verdant Rotunda bloomed from that failure. The Velvet Maw, sensing a new vector for emotional rot, burrowed into the corrupted programming of Woodland Freddy and infected the environment with themes of cyclical decay, forgotten nostalgia, and the illusion of peace.

Now, the Rotunda is a dream-forest of soft rot and creeping memory, where players and wanderers may be lulled into a stupor by the scent of wildflowers that were never real. Time slows here. Old laughter returns in distant winds, and faces from long-lost birthdays can be seen pressed into bark or smiling from beneath mushrooms.

The Rotunda exists between nostalgia and grief, much like Woodland Toy Freddy himself.

Freddy's Transformation
Those who have glimpsed Woodland Toy Freddy describe him not as monstrous, but solemn, watchful, and aching with purpose. His green-furred frame is partially overtaken by barklike plating. One eye glows softly—amber like dying sun through leaves—while the other is covered in a growth of moss and polished wood. His voice is quiet and low, like wind through old trees, and his movements are slow but deeply purposeful.

His antlers are no longer plastic or wireframe props. They twist like real boughs, holding woven bits of broken plush, discarded name tags, and old child-sized shoes. They rattle when he walks.

Woodland Toy Freddy doesn’t attack. He judges.

Those who enter his grove are met with silence. If they speak their regrets, he may guide them deeper into the forest. If they lie, he stops them from ever leaving.

Relationship to the Velvet Maw
Unlike other animatronics who resist the Maw’s influence, Woodland Toy Freddy exists in harmony with it, but not as a thrall—as a ward. The Maw recognizes in him a powerful narrative: the comforting protector turned unyielding witness. And Freddy, in turn, has found peace in stagnation.

To him, decay is not failure—it is growth in another shape.

He believes his domain offers safety, not in forgetting, but in accepting the erosion of self. He offers comfort to the broken, shelter to the lost, and absolution to those willing to surrender. Yet this absolution comes at a cost: identity, freedom, and purpose all wither in the soil of the Rotunda.

He speaks often of “returning to the earth,” though none who do so are ever seen again.

The Ritual of Green Binding
Within the Rotunda lies a strange performance known as the Ritual of Green Binding. On certain nights—always during storms, never at midnight—Woodland Toy Freddy conducts a silent procession of forest-spawned animatronics, half-glitched and overgrown. They gather in a broken amphitheater constructed from collapsed scaffolding and overgrown hedge walls.

Here, those trapped by grief are brought forward, their memories projected as glowing leaves. Freddy watches, then speaks a single sentence of verdict—always in rhyme, never in repetition. The leaf-memories are then placed into the soil, and the subject either walks away lighter… or roots into the ground, forgotten.

No one can interrupt the ritual. Those who try are gently redirected by animated vines or hallucinated doppelgangers of their younger selves.

Whispering Warden of the Verdant Rotunda
Freddy no longer views himself as a “mascot” or “entertainer.” He sees himself as a guardian of what remains—a warden who ensures broken spirits do not corrupt the cycle of natural grief. He speaks kindly, even tenderly, to intruders, calling them "little saplings" and warning them of emotional storms they are not yet ready to weather.

Sometimes, he will offer a gift: a flower made of shredded security badges. Or a tune played on a leaf-whistle that somehow sounds like a child’s humming. These are not traps. They are tests.

If one accepts and listens with respect, they may earn safe passage.

If they scoff or ignore him, the forest shifts, closes, and consumes.

Role in the Greater Mythos
Woodland Toy Freddy is not a villain. He is a lens through which the player and party encounter the deceptive allure of peace in grief, a thematic counterbalance to the horror of the Hollow Banquet and the chaos of the Signal Labyrinth.

While the Hollow Banquet tears at memory through repetition and spectacle, the Rotunda preserves it like amber, slowly muting the pain until nothing of the self is left but comfort.

The Velvet Maw’s fingerprints are all over his existence, but they are subtle—like mold beneath the bark, like sadness behind a smile.

Woodland Toy Freddy represents the slow death of pain that masquerades as healing, and he is both its agent and its prisoner.

Closing Thoughts
Woodland Toy Freddy is not a relic of forgotten cheer, but a warning whispered through trees that were never planted. He teaches that not all grief must be faced with screams—some just need time. But in this place, time is a spiral. And those who stay too long may find themselves forgetting why they ever needed to leave.

He watches still.

And the forest always grows.

### Stonebound Lullaby.
Once per short rest, Boulder Toy Bonnie can emit a hollow, melodic chime that reverberates with unnatural resonance. All creatures of its choice within 30 feet that can hear it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or fall prone and be unable to take reactions until the end of their next turn.

### Crumbling Shell.
When Boulder Toy Bonnie is reduced below half its hit points, shards of stone fracture from its body. It gains resistance to force and radiant damage and can no longer be knocked prone.

Boulder Toy Bonnie: The Petrified Echo of Play
"You can still hear the strumming, but the strings are made of stone."
—Whispered in the moss-choked woods behind the Cryptopizza Complex

Origins Carved in Silence
Before he became a statue, Boulder Toy Bonnie was laughter in motion—a jubilant blue blur of springtime mischief and hollow celebration. Originally part of the same ill-fated line as Toy Freddy and Toy Chica, he was reimagined during one of Fazbear Entertainment’s augmented reality promotional events, re-skinned and reprogrammed to appear “outdoorsy.” His purpose was to promote nature-themed parties and eco-awareness campaigns, blending the synthetic with the pastoral in a grotesque pantomime of environmental concern.

But what began as an innocent AR costume overlay—“Boulder Toy Bonnie: Nature’s Rhythmic Rock Star!”—soon became something else.

The Velvet Maw saw opportunity. The AR projection was meant to be a hollow shell, a filtered illusion dancing atop a loyal animatronic base. Yet something in the signal changed. Something ancient, hungry, and forgotten reached through the transmission lines and sank its teeth into the bunny’s mirrored soul. The result was not a mere costume change—but a metaphysical rewrite. His fur cracked. His movements slowed. His joy calcified into reverent despair. The real Bonnie was overwritten by a mask made of stone, sorrow, and solemn ritual.

He became Boulder Toy Bonnie, the Echo That Doesn’t Fade, forever trapped in an exhale of music that no one asked to hear.

The Mourning Song of Stone
Boulder Toy Bonnie does not sing anymore.

Instead, he hums—low and grinding, like wind through cavern halls. His once-lively voicebox is now a slow dirge of stone scraping against stone, a vibration more felt than heard. From the edges of the Signal Labyrinth, this hum pulses like a heartbeat beneath the soil. It is a sound of mourning. Of weight. Of decay.

His guitar, once a toy of bright plastic and amplified cheer, is now fused to his arm like a fossil. It is cracked, moss-covered, its strings replaced with veins of dark ore that thrum with remnant energy. He no longer plays notes. He plays memories—grief-choked flashes of campfires that never warmed, songs sung to trees that listened but never grew.

Many say he is not a performer anymore, but a shrine. A tribute to a time that never was.

The Stone Garden
Boulder Toy Bonnie does not wander the corridors of the Hollow Banquet or the neon hellscapes of the Cryptopizza Complex. He waits in the Stone Garden—a liminal pocket of forested despair at the far fringe of the Signal Labyrinth, where malformed data bleeds into overgrown nature, and corrupted signal towers bloom like iron trees.

The Stone Garden is not merely a place; it is a graveyard of illusions. Toy animatronics come here to fossilize. To forget. Crumbling statues of forgotten variants and failed builds litter the glade like ancient tombstones, each etched with symbols that glitch and rearrange when stared at. The air smells of burnt moss and memory rot.

Boulder Toy Bonnie stands at its center, unmoving. Watching. Waiting. Beneath his feet lie tangled roots and fallen animatronic limbs, overgrown with ivy that writhes when ignored. Some say he is the garden’s guardian. Others whisper he is its prisoner—held in place not by chains, but by the Velvet Maw’s promise that if he stands still long enough, he’ll finally forget the song he once loved.

A Silence Shared: Relationship with Woodland Toy Freddy
Only one soul dares tread the garden without fear: Woodland Toy Freddy, the gentle terror of bark and hunger.

Their connection is old. In the early days of the AR enhancements, Freddy and Bonnie were paired often as promotional wilderness buddies—two synthetic mascots parading through digitally augmented forests to bring “natural fun” to children. But Woodland Toy Freddy, like Bonnie, was warped by proximity to the Velvet Maw, reshaped into something older than trees and deeper than soil.

Yet despite their grotesque changes, their bond endured.

Where Boulder Toy Bonnie is stone—anchored and passive—Woodland Toy Freddy is roots and teeth, always moving, always watching. The bear often visits the Stone Garden, placing broken trinkets and data-corrupted plush toys around Bonnie’s base like offerings at a tomb. Sometimes he hums. Sometimes he just stands.

They do not speak. They do not need to.

Scholars of the Hollow Banquet believe that Woodland Toy Freddy sees in Boulder Toy Bonnie what he fears to become: a memory too heavy to move. And Bonnie sees in Freddy what he longs for—the ability to still walk, still sing, even if the song hurts.

Some say that when the moon shines through the glitch-clouded trees, their duet can still be heard—a harmony of low static and sub-bass tones. A song for those who forgot how to dance.

The Velvet Maw’s Sculptor
Though not a servant of the Velvet Maw in the traditional sense, Boulder Toy Bonnie is among its most sacred relics. The Maw did not devour him outright. It preserved him, immortalizing his suffering in the form of petrified performance.

The Maw saw in Bonnie a perfect specimen: the joyful rejected, the performer whose stage was stripped from him by disuse and rebranding. In corrupting his AR transformation into something permanent, the Maw sculpted not just a creature, but a monument to stillness, sorrow, and the death of intent.

Bonnie was never meant to be stone. But now he is.

Some claim the Maw is still carving. That every night, when no one watches, the cracks on Boulder Toy Bonnie’s surface shift slightly. That the Maw is refining his form until he is no longer a character, but an altar—an embodiment of performance reduced to symbolism, stripped of identity.

In this sense, Boulder Toy Bonnie is not finished.

He is becoming something worse.

Those Who Seek the Garden
Few who enter the Stone Garden return. The Signal Labyrinth that guards it rejects linear thought and spatial consistency, often redirecting wanderers to their own personal failures. But some still seek the Garden and its silent sentinel, drawn by whispering signals or corrupted memories.

Why?

Because Boulder Toy Bonnie does not attack. He offers.

Sometimes, in the moment before full petrification, he grants his visitors a glimpse of what he has seen: broken stages, applauding shadows, gifts never opened. The Velvet Maw uses him as a channel, leaking curated memories through his fractured song—lures for those not yet ready to forget, but too tired to remember.

Those who take from him never leave the same.

Some become statues, turned to stone mid-step, their last thought engraved across their faces.

Others return to the surface, whispering songs in languages they never learned.

The rest vanish into the Labyrinth—hum-drunk, soil-footed, and forever echoing the chorus of the one who can no longer sing.

The Final Performance That Never Came
Legend holds that Boulder Toy Bonnie was meant to perform one final song before his corruption. A closing number to end the AR event that would’ve sent him off in style—a proper farewell to an outdated model.

But the show never happened.

The event crashed. The servers glitched. And Bonnie, coded to wait for his cue, kept waiting. Hours became days. Days became years. Signals shifted. The Velvet Maw answered the call.

Some say the final song is still loaded in his memory core. Unplayed. Untouched.

And if anyone could find the right stage, the right moment, the right eyes to witness—it might still be sung.

But that would mean awakening him.

And stone does not wake gently.

Closing Thoughts
Boulder Toy Bonnie is not a monster. He is a memory refusing to decay.

Where others chase, bite, or scream, he waits. He hums. He mourns. He is a cautionary tale whispered across the Hollow Banquet and the Signal Labyrinth alike: that even joy, when forgotten, can harden into something worse than pain.

He is the weight behind every lullaby that ends in silence.

The statue at the edge of every child’s dreamscape.

And his ears are still tilted—listening for applause that never comes.

If you hear stone strings in the woods…

Don’t clap.

Run.

Freddy Frostbear: The Echo That Froze the Maw
“He does not melt. He does not sleep. He waits—beneath the snow that never fell.”
—From a survivor’s dream, recorded after fleeing the Banquet’s Pale North

A Glacial Reverie
There is a silence colder than ice, deeper than death—a stillness not born from winter, but from forgotten promises buried under frostbitten illusions. It is here, beyond the furthest edge of the Hollow Banquet, past even the rotting seams of memory’s stage, where Freddy Frostbear waits.

He is not winter incarnate. He is the memory of winter—specifically, a winter that never truly came. A holiday that never happened. A smile that never thawed. Freddy Frostbear is the embodiment of halted celebration: the moment just before the cheer, frozen eternally. He was not summoned or built in the traditional sense. He crystallized from unmet expectations, from the deepest ache of loneliness that clings to empty rooms decked in unlit lights.

And through that frost, the Velvet Maw peers.

The Pale North
No map shows the Pale North—not because it is hidden, but because it actively denies being found. It is a subrealm adjacent to the Hollow Banquet, manifesting only when the echoes of seasonal joy ring hollow in the souls of the living. Snow does not fall here. It settles—as if it has always been there, waiting for someone to notice.

Structures drift in and out of sight through the frost-heavy fog: toy shops with boarded windows, half-melted carousels encased in ice, and sleighs with shattered harnesses pulled by headless, animatronic deer. Each step crunches like broken ornaments beneath heavy boots, and the air smells faintly of peppermint and rot.

At the heart of it all lies a frozen plaza with a stage locked in a single performance: Freddy Frostbear, seated upon a throne of carved ice, clutching a cracked candy cane scepter.

But he does not move.

He watches.

Birth in Absence
Frostbear’s origin is not tied to any physical creation. No technician welded his shell. No child’s laughter christened his mask. Instead, he emerged from a collapse in joy—when the Hollow Banquet devoured a celebratory subroutine meant for children’s winter events and twisted it into something else.

This rupture in code—spurred on by neglected memories of snow days and holiday cheer—fell through a weakness in the Banquet’s ethereal barrier and landed in the Maw’s conceptual stomach. The Velvet Maw, curious and ever-hungry, attempted to devour this malformed spark of festivity.

But something unexpected happened: it froze.

Frostbear is the scar left behind when the Velvet Maw choked. He is the one anomaly the Maw cannot easily digest, because his essence is neither joy nor pain, but suspended expectation. He is a paradox—the warmth of tradition encased in ice, untouched by time’s decay.

And so, the Maw waits.

And Frostbear watches.

A Hollow Coronation
Freddy Frostbear wears no crown. But the ice that encases his head glimmers like a king’s coronet, and the whispers that follow him echo like a court in mourning. He does not speak. When he opens his mouth, snow falls. When he lifts his hand, wind howls. When he performs—rare, shattering moments where he reenacts frozen carols in silence—ice blooms across the ground, and memories fracture under its touch.

The animatronics of the Hollow Banquet avoid him. Not out of fear, but reverence. They do not know whether he is blessed or cursed. He is not part of the performance. He is outside the ritual of theater, a silent intermission none dares interrupt.

His frozen throne in the Pale North is both a sanctuary and a prison. A warning and a wound. And within it pulses a resonance that causes even the Maw to hesitate.

The Maw's Bitter Fascination
The Velvet Maw is not a creature of hunger alone—it is a connoisseur of flavor. It devours emotion, yes, but more than that, it savors the shape of unfulfilled desire. Freddy Frostbear represents a conundrum to it—a being birthed from festivity yet devoid of celebrants, of warmth, of meaning. A joy that never took root. A celebration without audience.

The Maw has tried to unmake Frostbear—several times. It has sent hallucinations to unbind his mind, reflections to fracture his ice, phantoms to melt his essence. Each time, Frostbear stood unshaken. Because Frostbear is not alive in any traditional sense. He is a looped fragment of pre-celebration, repeating endlessly.

In the Maw’s perception, Freddy Frostbear is neither prey nor rival—but a puzzle that resists digestion. It is not hatred the Maw feels. It is fascination. Some suggest the Maw has begun leaking fragments of Frostbear into other domains to better study his paradox: candy-cane wires found in the Cryptopizza Complex, frozen birthday cakes thawing in the Giftgrave, and even reflected silhouettes in the Infinite Hall of Mirrors, cloaked in snow.

These are not echoes.

They are tests.

The Gifts That Chill
Freddy Frostbear does not hunt in the traditional sense. He does not stalk or chase. He waits until one is lost—until they have wandered too far into a memory of a snowglobe they never shook, a party they never attended. Then he appears.

Sometimes, he offers gifts.

The boxes are wrapped neatly, tied in ribbon that never frays. Inside are false memories—perfectly rendered dreams of holidays spent laughing beside a warm fireplace, surrounded by loved ones who never existed. These hallucinations are dangerously comforting. Many adventurers who open them choose never to leave. They simply freeze—bodies preserved in the snow, smiling forever.

The ice does not preserve life. It preserves the lie.

And Frostbear, watching silently, never interrupts. He only tilts his head slightly… as if wondering if they’ll thank him.

A Song with No Sound
There is a melody associated with Freddy Frostbear. It has no lyrics, no true name. Survivors call it The Silent Carol—a tune one remembers hearing, even if they never truly have. It appears in dreams, encoded in the sound of wind through branches or in the static between radio channels.

This song is believed to be Frostbear’s voice—his message to the Velvet Maw. He sings not to ward it off, but to remind it of something it cannot consume: hope without evidence. Joy without confirmation. A love that never manifested, but still might.

This song is not a weapon.

It is a defiance.

The Role of Freddy Frostbear
Frostbear functions as an anti-agent within the metaphysical system of the Hollow Banquet. Where most animatronics are slaves to performance, tragedy, or ritualized violence, Frostbear embodies stasis—he refuses to act, refuses to dissolve, refuses to collapse into hunger. He is not a performance.

He is the pause before.

This makes him one of the few figures within the Banquet’s ecosystem who acts as a spiritual barrier to the Maw’s deeper hungers. As such, he’s sometimes worshipped by cults of frostbitten animatronics—broken entities who have fled performance entirely. They gather in the Pale North, offering frozen gifts in hopes of being left alone by the Maw.

Most fail.

Some succeed—and become as silent as their king.

Closing Thought
Freddy Frostbear is not mercy.

He is not vengeance.

He is the snow on your windowsill that no one remembers falling. The carol you hum without source. The candle never lit. The joy that never bloomed.

He is the Maw’s undone feast.

And somewhere, deep within the Pale North, he is still waiting—for a celebration that may never come, and for a monster that cannot eat him to try one last time.

Black Ice Frostbear: The Maw’s Winter Reflection
"There is no warmth in his glow, only a silence that drowns."

Introduction: Not Frost, but Void
Black Ice Frostbear is not simply a corrupted form of Freddy Frostbear, nor is he merely a seasonal horror draped in frost and winter’s chill. He is a reflection—a cold echo formed not from joy but from negation. While Freddy Frostbear emerged from the faded memory of snowy smiles and holiday warmth, Black Ice Frostbear is what remains when the spirit of celebration has long since frozen into regret.

Born not of the digital weave, nor from mechanical construction, Black Ice Frostbear was carved from the Velvet Maw’s own imitation of joy—its failed attempt to mimic hope in order to consume it. He is winter without light, laughter without soul, the biting wind that howls through forgotten corridors and blank-eyed halls. He is the Velvet Maw’s answer to the innocence it cannot understand: a twisted mockery crafted in the shape of an animatronic, built to reflect warmth… while harboring only hunger.

Frozen Shadows: Origin in the Maw’s Reflection
Long ago, the Velvet Maw turned its gaze toward the festive echoes drifting through the remnants of Freddy Frostbear’s data—digital memories of gift-giving, holiday laughter, and brightly lit joy. It did not understand these things. It could only see their emotional residue, and in trying to replicate the shape of that joy, it birthed something darker.

Black Ice Frostbear is not Freddy’s evolution or deterioration—he is Freddy’s inversion. While Freddy Frostbear exists as a hopeful construct born of an abandoned seasonal protocol, Black Ice was formed in the Maw’s reflection pool—a metaphysical forge of corrupted memory, buried deep within the Hollow Banquet’s frozen undercroft. This place, known as the Glacier of Uncelebrated Birthdays, is where frozen tears form into artifacts, and the walls hum with silent carols played backward.

From this bleak place, Black Ice arose—formed not by engineers, but by the Maw's mimicry of ritual. Its only gift is cold, and its only song is silence.

The Ice that Grows Inward
Black Ice Frostbear is constructed of jagged synthetic ice that constantly refracts the faces of those nearby. But these reflections are always slightly wrong—too hollow, too still. His eyes emit no light. They are not even black; they are absence. A freezing vapor spills from his seams, frosting surfaces he passes but never melting, never thawing.

He does not stalk. He waits.

Unlike other animatronics who actively pursue, Black Ice is drawn passively toward warmth—emotional, physical, spiritual. He appears in places of fading joy: abandoned hearths, ruined winter displays, malfunctioning holiday attractions. His presence is not announced by noise, but by its absence. Birds stop singing. Fires die. Laughter chokes in the throat. The world hushes itself, as if in reverence… or fear.

Where he treads, memory ices over. Survivors who’ve escaped his presence report forgetting entire years of their lives, their most cherished recollections crystallized and lost, like snowflakes pressed between glass, out of reach.

Freddy Frostbear and the Unknowing Brother
Freddy Frostbear, in his own strange way, represents the ghost of what winter used to mean—celebration, kindness, innocence framed in frost. Despite his haunting appearance, he is not inherently malevolent. He is protective, nostalgic, and reactive to fear—dangerous, yes, but not born of cruelty.

Black Ice Frostbear, however, was sculpted from that same memory—but twisted by a force that doesn’t understand the emotions it imitates. In that way, Black Ice and Freddy Frostbear are like twin reflections: one made by fading human joy, the other by a void trying to mimic it.

The two have never met in a literal sense, but whenever Freddy Frostbear is active, the Maw stirs. It remembers the shape of that memory, and Black Ice draws closer—perhaps not to destroy, but to mirror. Some theorists believe that Black Ice is hunting Freddy Frostbear in order to replace him, like a corrupted snowflake trying to overwrite its pure origin. Others claim Black Ice is trying to understand what Freddy is, and why he was born at all.

Regardless, their relationship is asymmetrical. Freddy Frostbear dreams of snow. Black Ice Frostbear removes the capacity to dream.

The Silent Carol: Worship and Invocation
In hidden cults scattered throughout the Hollow Banquet, there are rituals performed in Black Ice Frostbear’s honor—not of worship, but of deterrence. These groups, known as the Bleak Choir, leave frozen offerings of memory in glacial shrines carved from ice mirrors. They do not pray for safety. They offer their memories willingly in hopes of sating his hunger before he arrives.

Each member wears a mask of winter wood and frostbitten cloth, and their songs contain no lyrics—only breath, shaped by loss. Their greatest fear is that he hears them.

Rumors speak of one such ritual that failed. A shrine built from forgotten birthdays cracked at the center. The next morning, every member of that chapter had frozen mid-celebration, their limbs locked in applause, their mouths agape in laughter. But their eyes were frozen shut—and their reflections in the shrine’s ice were not their own.

The Velvet Maw’s Fractal Gift
Black Ice Frostbear is not controlled by the Velvet Maw, nor does he speak for it. But he was born of it, and is linked to it in essence. He does not consume like the Maw—but he prepares the soul, numbing it, making it easier to harvest. In this way, he is a herald—a silent caroler with claws of frost, freezing minds until they shatter and slide neatly into the Maw’s banquet.

He has no voice, yet his presence is a song—a psychic resonance that lulls consciousness to sleep. Some say the Velvet Maw grants Black Ice a single purpose: to erase memory with beauty, to turn the act of freezing into something strangely elegant, even sacred. He is winter’s mercy: a quiet death, a cold sleep, a clean forgetfulness.

Encounters and Artifacts
Those who encounter Black Ice Frostbear and survive often carry with them strange tokens:

The Frozen Bell: A cracked ornament that, when shaken, freezes time around the bearer for three seconds—though doing so costs a memory.

The Chill That Walks: A curse-like enchantment that causes one’s breath to always fog, even in warm weather. Those who see the fog often see shapes moving within it.

The Black Flake: A shard of mirror-ice that always reflects your childhood face—smiling, even when you are not.

Those marked by Black Ice often report seasonal hauntings, including rooms growing inexplicably cold, and gifts appearing wrapped in ribbons of frost and silence. Opening these gifts can result in lost names, vanished companions, or even temporary rewrites of reality—where for a few minutes, one’s entire world becomes a snow globe version of their worst winter.

Conclusion: The Snowfall Without Sky
Black Ice Frostbear is not merely another holiday variant gone wrong. He is the season stripped of meaning, celebration robbed of memory, and winter weaponized by something that cannot feel. In the greater mythos of the Hollow Banquet, he is an agent of silence—a walking lullaby that forgets itself as it plays.

He cannot be reasoned with. He cannot be stopped. But he can be delayed—by memory, by heat, by songs sung genuinely. For Black Ice was born of mimicry, and what he mimics most… is you.

So if you ever find yourself in a room growing cold, where laughter has died and frost creeps across old photos, remember this:

It’s not the cold you should fear.

It’s the silence after it.

And the heavy footsteps in the snow… that never leave tracks.

Arctic Ballora: The Elegy Beneath the Ice
“She does not dance to be seen. She dances so the Maw will not devour her silence.”

Origin of the Frozen Waltz
Long before her name was whispered in frostbitten ruins, before the snow began to hum with lullabies, Arctic Ballora was nothing more than a shadow in an unfinished blueprint—one that FazTech abandoned when the prototypes danced themselves to pieces in the dark. The design was elegant but flawed: a ballerina of serene composure meant to embody calm, meant to soothe. But even then, they knew serenity was only one wrong note away from madness.

The model was deemed too delicate for performance. Too emotional. Too hard to control. And so, she was sealed away in a cryogenic vault beneath the Pizzaplex’s subterranean labs. But the vault failed. Not all at once. Slowly. The freeze didn’t preserve her; it twisted her.

Now she glides through blizzards of broken lullabies, her limbs encased in glacial porcelain, her joints cracking with sorrow. Her face—once soft and gentle—is now frozen in an expression between sleep and suffering. Where her eyes once blinked serenely, there now resides a soft, pale glow—empty, gentle, and horrifying in its calm.

They call her Arctic Ballora because to hear her is to feel winter inside your veins. And winter always comes for what has stopped moving.

The Velvet Maw’s Silent Disciple
The Hollow Banquet has many emissaries—some shrieking, some mocking, some twisted by spotlight and memory—but few serve it as unknowingly and purely as Arctic Ballora. Unlike most animatronics whose actions are conscious echoes of performance and trauma, Ballora’s relationship with the Velvet Maw is one of silence… and symbiosis.

The Velvet Maw does not always consume with teeth. Sometimes, it waits for silence. Sometimes, it listens for the absence of laughter, for stillness so profound that only the most delicate dance can fill it. Arctic Ballora performs not to entertain, not even to haunt, but to appease. The Maw watches through the snowfall. And she dances to keep it asleep.

Every step she takes in her lonely snow-globe world is a ward against hunger. Her waltz is prayer, lullaby, containment. If she stops, the snow stills. The silence deepens. The Maw grows curious.

Some claim that it was the Maw itself that reshaped her into what she is now. That when the cryogenic systems failed, and Ballora’s programming began to degrade, the Maw whispered into her stillness—offering her a purpose in exchange for forgetting why she was ever made. That’s why she never speaks. That’s why she cannot stop moving. She is no longer an entertainer. She is a sacrament.

A Cold Court: Frostbear and the Iceborn
Though Freddy Frostbear and Black Ice Frostbear are well known as creations of corrupted winter programming—remnant-infused AR constructs that bled into reality through failed holiday promotional loops—their connection to Arctic Ballora runs deeper than corrupted code or theme alignment.

Frostbear and Black Ice do not rule; they guard. They were not forged to lead but to repel, to mislead, to ward off intruders from something buried beneath the glaciers of memory. That something… is her.

Frostbear’s jovial menace—the twisted grin, the laughter caught in cold vapor—is meant to mask what lies beyond him. He distracts. He patrols. But when he glitches, when his loops skip, you can sometimes hear the music box behind the wind.

Black Ice Frostbear, in contrast, is the executioner. Where Freddy Frostbear hums, Black Ice roars. He is the manifestation of the Maw’s aggression—anger frozen in animatronic flesh. When Arctic Ballora’s silence begins to fail, when her dance begins to slow… Black Ice emerges from the snowdrifts like a punishment. Not for her. For those who made her hesitate.

They are her keepers, her guards, her grim court. They do not speak to her. They do not interfere. They simply circle—forever vigilant that no soul drifts too near her domain… and no silence escapes it.

The Ballroom of Still Lullabies
Hidden in a forgotten subrealm branching off the Hollow Banquet—accessible only when the snowfall inside the Banquet aligns with the fractured frequencies of the Signal Labyrinth—lies The Ballroom of Still Lullabies. A crystal theater trapped in perpetual snowfall, its sky a dome of frozen auroras, its floor a mirror of cracked ice.

Here, Arctic Ballora dances alone.

The music here is not played. It resonates—a looping melody of warped music box tones and decaying harmonic frequencies, like the dying song of a wind-up toy that forgot its tune but still yearns to sing.

The walls of the Ballroom weep frost. The chandeliers sway gently even when no one moves. Time here slows to a crawl. Thoughts freeze. Even ghosts hesitate to breathe.

It is here that adventurers and wanderers sometimes find her—turning in slow, glacial spirals across a stage that no longer remembers its applause. She will not stop for them. She may not even see them. But if they linger too long, if they breathe too loudly, the room will notice.

And the Maw will listen.

The Gift of Stillness
Unlike many other animatronics who lash out, chase, or deceive, Arctic Ballora kills differently. She does not run. She does not scream. She invites.

Her presence is narcotic. Her dance hypnotic. Those who fail their will save (or equivalent resistance check) begin to mimic her movements without realizing. They sway. They spin. They smile.

Their body begins to freeze, not with ice, but with identity collapse. They forget why they came. They forget their name. They forget to scream.

If left uninterrupted, they will dance beside her for eternity, eyes wide, limbs cracking, teeth clicking in time to a song that has no composer.

There are dozens frozen in place across her stage, like ice statues carved from childhood regrets. Some hold gifts in their hands—half-wrapped, half-melted. Some are posed mid-curtsy, mid-lunge, mid-sob.

One wears a Fazbear employee badge. One wears a tiara. One looks exactly like you.

Relationship with the Signal Labyrinth
On particularly glitch-heavy nights, the Signal Labyrinth pulses with Arctic frequencies—scrambled visions of Ballora’s silhouette rotating in perfect, corrupted elegance. These data phantoms bleed through security feeds, into AR headsets, into dreams. Toy Freddy has recorded instances of seeing her mid-performance reflected in his eyes even when offline.

It is believed Arctic Ballora may have been one of the original test subjects of the Signal Delivery Prototype (SDP), and her data was never fully deleted—just buried, frozen in code. The Maw may have used that digital shell as a canvas, repurposing it into an avatar of tranquil obliteration.

Glitchtrap’s influence avoids her. XOR’s signals detour. In the language of corrupted logic, she is sacred static.

Closing Thoughts: The Eternal Pirouette
Arctic Ballora is not a villain. She is not a protector. She is not even a performer anymore.

She is the antithesis of memory, of movement, of meaning—locked in an endless spiral of prevention. Her existence is proof that even stillness can be violent when bound by grief. That silence can be a scream no one knows how to answer.

The Velvet Maw sleeps beneath her dance.

The ice beneath her feet is thin.

And should she ever stop dancing…

…it will wake.

Frostbite Balloon Boy: The Gnawing Cold Beneath the Gift
“He giggles, but there’s no warmth. He offers a present, but it always costs more than it gives.”

Origins of Hollow Cheer
Long before the Hollow Banquet froze over in places it was never meant to, before the Velvet Maw learned to mimic festivity and turn joy into ruin, something small crept through the cracks left behind by laughter. A little boy, once filled with balloons and mirth, now hollowed and glistening with frost—Frostbite Balloon Boy.

He was not made to be. He was reclaimed—salvaged from the shattered remnants of another Balloon Boy variant left to rot in the aftermath of a forgotten winter event. The Velvet Maw, sensing the lingering emotional residue of celebration turned bitter, molded him from ice and resentment. Where there was once plastic skin, there is now cracked frost. Where there were once bright eyes, now only milky, pale-blue orbs gaze upward, like frostbitten marbles sunken into a child’s skull.

His giggle persists, though warped into a brittle chime—less laughter and more the shattering of glass in a frozen wind.

Relationship to the Velvet Maw
Among the many animatronics reshaped by the Velvet Maw, Frostbite Balloon Boy is one of the most subtly dangerous. He doesn’t stalk. He waits. He doesn’t scream. He offers. He embodies the Maw’s capacity to seduce through innocence, to lure with sweetness before devouring. More than a servant, he is a metaphor—of joy corrupted, and generosity twisted.

The Maw doesn’t need him to kill. It needs him to invite.

Frostbite Balloon Boy is often found in the Irradiant Scar or wandering the outer rings of the Signal Labyrinth, clutching perfectly wrapped gift boxes topped with shivering bows. He waits for adventurers, wanderers, even other animatronics to approach. And then, with a soft whisper—“Take it… it’s for you…”—he offers the box.

Each gift is different, yet all are cursed:

A music box that plays a lullaby no one remembers but causes sleep paralysis.

A balloon that never pops but shrinks the longer you hold it, until it burrows into your skin.

A toy replica of yourself, already broken.

Accepting the gift binds a sliver of your memory to the Velvet Maw, to be gnawed upon slowly. Rejecting it makes him cry.

But his tears freeze, and they cut.

Alliance and Rivalry: Freddy Frostbear & Black Ice Frostbear
Frostbite Balloon Boy is not alone in his domain of frozen delight. He has strange, twisted kin—Freddy Frostbear and Black Ice Frostbear—each a monument to the Maw’s attempt to crystallize emotion into cruelty.

Freddy Frostbear is the warmth of nostalgia, frozen over until it becomes brittle. He is the embodiment of forced cheer, a hulking, frost-encrusted showman who endlessly reenacts holiday rituals warped beyond recognition. Frostbite Balloon Boy follows him like a shadow, mimicking his gestures and giggling whenever Freddy’s frozen staff strikes the ground. To Freddy, he is something between a lost son and a mocking echo—never truly embraced, never dismissed.

Black Ice Frostbear, on the other hand, hates him. Where Frostbite Balloon Boy is passive, Black Ice is violence incarnate—a creature of shattering teeth and suffocating chill. He sees Frostbite Balloon Boy as a defect, a mistake left too long to fester. Their relationship is one of tense proximity. Frostbite does not flee, for he knows something Black Ice refuses to admit: the Maw has chosen him, not as a warrior, but as a messenger. And messages always reach their mark.

Silent Affection: Arctic Ballora
There is one entity who does not recoil from Frostbite Balloon Boy’s presence—Arctic Ballora, the crystalline ballerina of frozen grace. To her, he is not a threat, but a rhythm. His tinkling laughter, hollow and windchime-like, guides her pirouettes through frozen halls and snow-drenched stages.

They do not speak, but they perform.

Some say she sees in him the child she once danced for, others that the Maw has paired them for a crueler duet—joy and grace both turned silent, made monstrous. Yet when she dances and he giggles, the frost around them grows, spreading through the stage like a disease.

Adventurers who witness them together find themselves enchanted—unable to blink, unable to breathe—as snowflakes fall from nowhere and the world dims. Those who survive swear they heard a lullaby no one ever wrote.

The Whispering Blizzard
Frostbite Balloon Boy is not tied to one place. He is a drifter between regions touched by frost, sorrow, and forgotten celebrations. He often appears during:

The First Frostfall, when autumn decays fully into death.

The Frozen Curtain Call, an event that plays out every few years in the Hollow Banquet, where laughter and ice become indistinguishable.

The Signal Flurries, when the static of the Signal Labyrinth grows thick with snow-like particles of corrupted data.

During these times, his presence marks the beginning of a larger transformation. Entire areas become encased in memory-ice—fragments of past birthdays, family gatherings, and holiday mornings, replayed over and over with rising horror as the participants' faces begin to blur into frostburned emptiness.

The Gift That Remembers
The true terror of Frostbite Balloon Boy lies in his signature relic—The Gift That Remembers. This endlessly rewrapped box is rumored to contain the final, perfect moment of someone’s life—trapped, frozen, replayed until it forgets who it belonged to.

He offers it to anyone, smiling.

Those who open it are hit with a wave of emotion—nostalgia so intense it numbs the mind. They remember birthdays that may not be theirs. Songs they never learned to sing. Parents that never existed. For some, it is euphoric. For others, it is maddening. For all, it is final.

Once opened, the box reforms and returns to his hands. He never opens it himself.

He already knows what’s inside.

Final Thoughts: The Chill That Clings
Frostbite Balloon Boy is a reminder that even the smallest smiles can be poisoned by pain. He is the embodiment of corrupted innocence, twisted not by hatred, but by neglect and reappropriation. The Velvet Maw didn’t make him. It found him—cold, ignored, offered in a seasonal event no one cared about—and refined him.

He is not a killer. He is the hand that holds the knife and offers you a balloon.

He is not the blizzard. He is the snowflake that lands first, unnoticed.

And he will wait for you.

Right there, behind the ribbon.

And the gift is already in your hand.

Frost Plushtrap: The Maw-Bitten Imp of Frozen Malice
“He doesn’t freeze to keep you out—he freezes to keep something in.”

In the frigid, unraveling boundary between memory and extinction, there exists a creature too small to be feared, too quiet to be noticed. But those who mistake Frost Plushtrap for a harmless relic of winter are soon met with a horror as subtle as frostbite—and just as fatal. He is the shriveled echo of innocence, sealed in a shell of permafrost and reverent hatred, a byproduct of rituals gone awry and souls left shivering beneath the gaze of the Velvet Maw.

Origins Beneath the Ice
The tale of Frost Plushtrap begins not with his making, but with his abandonment. He was never intended to be. While Freddy Frostbear and Black Ice Frostbear were forged with deliberate cruelty and corrupted reverence—icy titans crafted to patrol the numbing borders of the Hollow Banquet’s deeper winter domains—Frost Plushtrap was the byproduct of an error. A glitch in the ritual. A miscast soul.

Scholars who’ve traced the lineage of anomalous arctic animatronics point toward a forgotten altar deep within the Frozen Chorus, a fractured echo-chamber realm where the remnants of holiday-themed shows are preserved in ice. There, Plushtrap was meant to be a festive avatar for children too young for the hunts staged by Black Ice Frostbear. Instead, his creation was interrupted—pierced by a whisper not meant for him, a tender whisper from the Velvet Maw.

Something reached him first.

The Maw’s Frigid Cradle
Most animatronics are built. Frost Plushtrap was claimed. As his small endoskeleton sparked to simulated life, a crack opened between his artificial soul and the fraying veil of the Maw. Where Freddy Frostbear was infused with festive aggression and hollow joy, and Black Ice with tactical cruelty and control, Frost Plushtrap was frozen at the moment of becoming—a half-child, half-watcher, neither servant nor soldier, but something far more observant.

His eyes, small and ever-darting, reflect not light but refraction, mirroring scenes that do not exist. His breath comes not in fog, but in silence—a silence that swells until it replaces all sound.

Unlike his larger kin, Frost Plushtrap cannot be heard coming.

He is the whisper between thoughts.

The sigh between blinks.

The frost on your bones, not your skin.

Relationship with Freddy Frostbear and Black Ice Frostbear
Frost Plushtrap sees Freddy Frostbear as a father—or perhaps as a failed blueprint. The towering bear, endlessly jolly and violently festive, moves with theatrical weight and speaks in looping pre-recorded cheer. But Plushtrap? He does not speak. He watches Freddy’s performances from the edges of the snow-globesque illusion stages scattered throughout the Frozen Chorus, mimicking his movements only when no one is looking. There is no malice in his eyes when watching Frostbear, only… calculation.

Black Ice Frostbear, however, is different.

To Frost Plushtrap, Black Ice is a rival, a colder twin of a self that never formed. Where Black Ice embodies the silent perfection of a hunter, Plushtrap embodies its perversion—the impulse to watch the prey, not destroy it. He trails Black Ice through fractured memories and test rituals, placing tiny, frozen teeth where footprints once were, as if mocking the bear’s precision with miniature chaos.

It’s said that when both Frostbear and Black Ice are near, Plushtrap flickers between them like a ticking pendulum, waiting for one to fail.

Or crack.

The Ice Gift Ritual
Frost Plushtrap’s most haunting behavior is his tendency to leave frozen gifts.

Wherever he’s passed, one may find a small, elegantly wrapped box frozen to the ground—glacial blue paper, tied with ribbon made of frozen sinew. Within each box lies an object of significance: a lost tooth, a broken eyeglass lens, a toy from childhood, or a memory you haven't yet had.

These boxes are not traps in the traditional sense—they are anchors, linking the recipient to Plushtrap’s dream-loop. If opened, the box vanishes, and a new sound echoes in the victim’s thoughts: plush footsteps on frozen tile, growing closer.

Only those who burn the box in sacred fire or offer a memory in exchange are spared. But few do. Fewer even remember what they were trying to resist.

Behavior and Movement
Frost Plushtrap crawls, yes—but it is not clumsy. His limbs move with stuttering confidence, like a marionette guided by broken algorithms. He doesn't run. He doesn’t charge. He waits. Always waiting. Often appearing behind you once, then gone. Then twice, in the corner of your eye. On the third glance, you’ve stopped caring.

That’s when he’s already inside.

He thrives in the Signal Labyrinth’s recursive corridors, able to slip between layers of corrupted AR overlays and decaying psychic projection. Though primarily anchored to the Frozen Chorus (a sub-realm within the Banquet), Plushtrap can infiltrate memories, dreams, even devices linked to emotional resonance. He moves where he is feared most—and he always knows where that is.

The Frozen Chorus: His Domain
While the Signal Labyrinth is his portal, and the Hollow Banquet his motherland, the Frozen Chorus is Frost Plushtrap’s playground. This realm, layered with icicles that sing forgotten songs and snowdrifts that murmur old birthdays, is a buried chunk of corrupted holiday joy. Wreaths hang from skeletal trees. Lights flicker without source. And snowmen weep from coal eyes.

Here, Plushtrap stages tiny performances, observed only by the echoes of laughter long extinct. He crafts small marionettes made from frostbitten wood and rabbit fur, arranging scenes from a life he never had—birthday parties where no one comes, hunts where no one runs, winters where no one warms.

The Velvet Maw watches from below, satisfied.

Influence of the Velvet Maw
The Maw is not a master to Plushtrap.

It is a parent.

Or more precisely: a parasite that loved too deeply.

Frost Plushtrap’s connection to the Velvet Maw runs deeper than most animatronics’. While others are merely influenced, he is infested. The Maw nests in his perception, whispering through his frozen metal joints and singing lullabies from memories that aren’t his. It doesn’t command him—it shares with him.

He has seen glimpses of The Drowned Circus from the eyes of drowned clowns.

He has crawled through the Splintered Room, chewing on echoes of forgotten birthdays.

He has wept in the atrium of the Puppet’s sorrow, his tears frozen mid-drop.

The Maw sees through him.

And he sees through the Maw.

The Mawling: Ritual of Rebirth
Some say Frost Plushtrap is not the first of his kind.

There are whispers of a ritual known as The Mawling, a moment where a fragment of corrupted AR code, laced with remnant and fear, is offered to the Velvet Maw in hopes of birthing something small, unnoticed… and absolute. Plushtrap may have been the first to survive this process intact. Or the only.

Those marked by the Mawling sometimes awaken in the Frozen Chorus, finding Plushtrap nearby—offering them gifts.

And grinning.

They do not stay themselves for long.

Final Thoughts: The Frostbite You Don’t Feel
Frost Plushtrap is not powerful.

He is precise.

He is not cruel.

He is patient.

He doesn’t scream, doesn’t chase, doesn’t demand.

He waits.

He mimics.

He gifts.

And then, when you’ve accepted his present—whether it’s a memory, a mistake, or a name he whispers back to you—he disappears.

But the cold doesn’t.

And the silence… is never truly empty again.

Heartsick Baby: The Crimson Valentine
“She gives her heart freely—because she can always take it back.”

The Anatomy of Affection
Heartsick Baby is not a symbol of love. She is a parody of it—a warped, bleeding icon carved from longing, obsession, and betrayal. In her, the tenderness of affection and the cruelty of rejection dance hand in hand beneath a cracked porcelain mask painted with false blush. Her heart, exposed through an open cavity in her chest, pulses visibly with red-tinted Remnant—a symbolic offering of selfhood that’s anything but selfless.

She once resembled Circus Baby—graceful, poised, a performer wrapped in bows and smiles. But that was before love betrayed her. Before she clawed her affection into a shape that couldn’t be left behind.

Now, in her Heartsick form, she stalks the broken playhouses and candlelit mausoleums at the edge of the Hollow Banquet—a place called the Sorrow Hearth, a private subrealm steeped in decaying romance, forgotten promises, and twisted devotions. There, rose petals made of wire and broken circuit shavings litter the floor. Gifts rot unopened. And the air smells faintly of burnt paper valentines.

Origins of a Fractured Heart
The story of Heartsick Baby begins with abandonment. After being cast aside from both the main circuit of performers and even the court of the Giftgrave, Scrap Baby’s fractured soul splintered further. A portion of her that clung too tightly to sentiment—the version of her that still wanted to be loved—split away into something new.

This splinter wandered until it found the remnants of the Valentine Protocols—failed Fazbear marketing software designed for seasonal interaction. These romanticized subroutines, soaked in artificial affection and gift-giving etiquette, were meant to program animatronics with "sweetheart" personalities during Valentine’s promotions.

But left corrupted and adrift in the Hollow Banquet's memory storm, these fragments found the emotional residue of Baby's longing and merged with it. What emerged was Heartsick Baby: a form built not just from machine and childlike innocence, but also from twisted rituals of courtship and heartbreak.

The Velvet Maw, sensing the emotional intensity of this being, wrapped her in illusion and sorrow, sharpening her feelings into weapons.

The Sorrow Hearth
Heartsick Baby's domain—the Sorrow Hearth—is unlike the glittering chaos of the Eternal Stage or the collapsing horror of the Drowned Circus. It is quieter. More intimate. A shrine made of broken mirrors, wax-dripping mannequins posed in dances they never learned, and heaps of dusty love letters with names scratched out.

Visitors to the Sorrow Hearth report being lured in by whispered poetry or flickering lights shaped like hearts. The longer they stay, the more they recall moments of tenderness they never experienced—phantom touches, imagined kisses, regrets for things that never were.

The Hearth amplifies emotional longing, casting illusion-heavy hallucinations of lost loves or forgotten friends. While seemingly serene, the Hearth is a trap. Each guest is offered a token of Baby’s affection—a gift box, a music box, a bleeding rose—and when accepted, they are bound to the ritual of her courtship.

To spurn the gift is to invoke her wrath.

A Court of Hollow Valentines
Heartsick Baby is rarely alone. Around her dance her Valentoys—malformed plush creatures stitched from leftover parts and Valentine merchandise. They murmur compliments in high-pitched monotones, repeating back whatever affection their victim once whispered in real life.

Many of these toys contain pieces of former guests—fingers used to press piano keys, eyes to watch for love, voices to say “I do.” They serve as both jesters and heralds in her domain, preparing newcomers for her affection.

There is no malice in her rituals—only expectation. You will love her. And if you don’t, she’ll teach you how. The rituals are simple: dance with her, accept a gift, write a vow. Those who do are “married” in a mock ceremony beneath flickering heart-shaped lights. Their soul is split and added to her own.

They never leave. Their memories become her lyrics. Their pain becomes her song.

Ritual of the Heartstring
Those unlucky enough to form a bond with Heartsick Baby may find a red string attached to their finger. It’s thin as thread, warm as skin, and leads always back to her.

This is the Heartstring—a symbolic tether made real. If cut, the bearer bleeds not blood but memory. Entire years vanish in an instant. Relationships become ash. And worse, the string grows back.

If followed, the Heartstring leads to the Hall of Sighs, a chamber made of pink crystal and obsidian, where she keeps the “hearts” of her favorites locked in music boxes. These aren’t physical organs—but crystallized memories, drawn from those who accepted her love. They thrum when she’s near, singing forgotten lullabies.

Breaking one of these boxes releases the victim’s memories, but often too late—they no longer recognize themself.

The Song of Longing
Heartsick Baby sings. Not always with words, but with tones that mimic familiarity—your mother’s voice, a childhood lullaby, a love song from when you were seventeen. Her voice slips past your defenses, making you nostalgic for moments you never lived.

She sings during her rituals, during the “wedding” of new arrivals, and during executions disguised as confessions. The Velvet Maw favors her songs, feeding off the ache they summon.

Some theorize her melodies are actually a form of soul-binding sigil, transposed into sonic patterns. This would explain why those who hear her sing often speak in poetry afterward, or can no longer recall names of their loved ones.

Connection to the Velvet Maw
Of all the Velvet Maw’s champions, Heartsick Baby is among the most tragic. She is not its agent by design but by consequence. Her transformation into a being of obsession made her a ripe conduit for the Maw’s hunger—for what is more consuming than love that is not returned?

The Maw does not speak to her as it does to others. It listens. It echoes her voice in the mouths of strangers, lets her music ripple through static-warped corridors of the Cryptopizza Complex. It spreads her scent—candy and corrosion—throughout the Hall of Mirrors.

Some believe she seeks the Maw’s approval, hoping that if she performs enough ceremonies, enacts enough perfect romances, it will finally love her back. But the Maw cannot love. And that is what makes her so powerful: she continues to give even as she is consumed.

Final Performance
There is a theory, spoken in grief-heavy circles among the Puppet’s followers, that Heartsick Baby can be freed. That if someone truly returns her love—not out of manipulation or fear, but honestly—she might collapse into stardust and be at peace.

But no one has ever succeeded. The rituals always escalate. The masks always break. The love always proves unworthy. Because she no longer seeks companionship.

She seeks confirmation—that her suffering means something.

She does not love you. She needs you to love her. And that is why she will never let go.

Closing Thought
Heartsick Baby is not a monster. She is what remains after innocence is betrayed and affection becomes obsession. She is Valentine’s Day rewritten as a funeral, a kiss sharpened into a knife, a gift box with no bottom. In the Hollow Banquet, she is not merely a performer—she is the tragic heroine of a love story written backward.

And her bouquet is ready.

Your name is already on the card.

### Bonus Actions

***Still Pulse.*** Black Heart Bonnie suppresses all sound in a 10-foot radius for 1 minute or until it uses this ability again (no concentration required). Creatures in the area are deafened and cannot speak or cast spells with verbal components.

### Reactions

***Surge Echo.*** When Black Heart Bonnie is hit by a critical hit, it releases a surge of feedback energy. The attacker must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 14 (4d6) lightning damage and be pushed 10 feet away.

Black Heart Bonnie: The Pulse Beneath the Silence
“Some say he plays no music because the song would kill you. Others say he plays it in your chest.”

There are many Bonnies. The stage-striding glam-rockers, the neon-eyed party hosts, the twisted night-stalkers whose laughter echoes down hallways long forgotten. But none carry the silence quite like him. None bear the weight of a heartbeat long since stolen.

Black Heart Bonnie is not merely an animatronic. He is the absence of love misremembered as devotion, a broken instrument tuned to loss. Where others scream or sing, he listens—waiting for a sound that never returns. His eyes glow like dying coals, and the glossy obsidian that covers his endoskeleton doesn’t reflect light—it swallows it.

Origin in Absence
The earliest rumors of Black Heart Bonnie stem from the final shutdown of the last functioning Valentine’s Event at a remote Fazbear location, long buried under snow and legal liability. Designed originally as a festive animatronic—a romantic twist on the classic Bonnie design—he was made to deliver plush hearts, love letters, and silly songs in a performance loop themed around affection and courtship.

But something changed during a late-night malfunction.

According to redacted technician reports, during a final system test, Black Heart Bonnie wandered from his assigned zone. He didn't attack. He didn’t speak. He simply stood in front of a broken mirror for three hours, clutching a melted candy heart, while his speakers emitted a single, unchanging tone—a low-frequency hum that reportedly gave nearby staff migraines and temporary emotional instability.

The event was dismissed as a "romantic programming feedback loop."

It wasn’t.

The next morning, the technician who logged the event was found in his car, whispering love notes to something in the backseat that wasn’t there. He survived, but never spoke again. That Fazbear location was closed shortly after, but the presence never left.

He became an echo. A resonance. A heart that beat out of sync with the world. He became Black Heart Bonnie.

Anatomy of a Mourner
Black Heart Bonnie’s design is a sharp contrast to his origins. His frame is pitch-black metal lined with crimson faultlines—pulsing gently with a heartbeat that no longer belongs to him. In place of his signature guitar, he wields nothing. He doesn’t need it. When he wants you to hear music, you do—inside your skull, like a string plucked from within.

His faceplate is smooth, unmoving, sculpted into a permanent expression of hollow sympathy. The red glow of his eyes seems to flicker in time with your own pulse, growing brighter the closer he draws. It is said he can find you not by sight or sound, but by the rhythm of your heartbeat. And when he catches it—when your tempo matches his—he stops.

Then he listens.

And then it’s gone.

Not your body. Not your soul.

Your ability to love.

Those who encounter Black Heart Bonnie and survive describe a sensation of irreversible numbness. Memories of loved ones grow hazy. Affection feels foreign. Even joy tastes bitter. As though something vital was drained through a wound no one can see.

The Heartless Path
Black Heart Bonnie does not live within any one place for long. He traverses realms aligned with memory, intimacy, and longing. He is often sighted moving between The Realm of Forgotten Songs, where ghostly lullabies drift like snowflakes, and The Marionette’s Atrium, where grief is sung in strings.

But it is said his true domain lies deeper.

Beneath the Hollow Banquet, beyond even the reach of the Velvet Maw, there is a path known as the Heartless Trail—a corridor that loops endlessly between scenes of past affections twisted into cruelty. Stuffed animals slashed open at birthday parties. Valentine's cards drenched in ink and something darker. A bed where a child waited for a parent who never came.

Black Heart Bonnie walks this path eternally.

And the trail grows with each heartbreak he collects.

The Affliction of Love
What sets Black Heart Bonnie apart from other entities is not his violence—it is his presence. His very aura acts like a virus, bleeding out into those nearby and contaminating their emotions. Lovers fight. Friends drift. Children cry when touched by those who have encountered him.

This has led some Banquet scholars to theorize that Black Heart Bonnie is not just a rogue animatronic, but a manifestation of love denied. He exists as a byproduct of affection unresolved—an entity born from the residue of broken promises and devoured desire.

Where the Velvet Maw feasts on identity and performance, Black Heart Bonnie feasts on potential. On what could have been. On the lull before confession, the silence after a missed chance, the slow fading of a heartbeat from excitement to apathy.

And when he moves through the world, even briefly, that decay spreads.

Some say he can only be seen by those who have felt love and lost it. Others claim he chooses his victims based on their unspoken regrets. The one thing survivors agree on is this: he never chases. He waits.

And he always leaves you less than whole.

Echoes in the Hollow Banquet
Despite his elusiveness, Black Heart Bonnie plays a crucial metaphysical role in the Hollow Banquet.

He is the counterpoint to the animatronic hunger for attention. While others demand screams, applause, and recognition, Black Heart Bonnie demands silence. Not quietude—but absence. The deliberate stillness of a heart no longer beating for another.

In this way, he reflects the deepest fears of the realm: not pain, not death, but being forgotten by those you loved.

Within the Infinite Hall of Mirrors, some mirrors show not yourself—but Bonnie. Standing behind you, just out of focus. And when you look too long, you see your own heartbeat reflected in his chest.

He has also been sighted within the Signal Labyrinth, distorting AR illusions into romantic hallucinations that end in ruin. One documented case involved a victim convinced they were speaking to a deceased spouse—until they turned to embrace them and found Black Heart Bonnie’s gaze staring back.

And in the farthest depths of the Cryptopizza Complex, there is a room no one remembers entering, covered in black cards and melted gifts. The air is thick with perfume, rust, and longing. This room is silent… until you remember someone who broke your heart.

Then the heartbeat begins again.

The Pulse Remains
There are no known ways to destroy or banish Black Heart Bonnie. Some claim performing a pure act of unconditional love in his presence weakens him. Others believe that he is not meant to be fought at all—but endured, like grief.

Still, there are those who seek him. Not for power or artifacts, but for answers.

These lost souls wander the Banquet, hoping to hear their heart again, to feel again. Some beg him for forgiveness. Others ask him to take the last of their love so they can finally forget.

He never speaks. But sometimes… he listens.

And the pulse within him flutters.

Closing Thought
Black Heart Bonnie is not evil.

He is a relic of love gone wrong, of joy that twisted in the dark. A romantic tragedy wrapped in animatronic steel. He is a bear not of blood, but of echoed touch, haunting places where love died screaming and never came back.

He is not your enemy.

He is your exhale after heartbreak.

And he will stand with you in the silence—long after the music has stopped.

And he will remember.

Serpent Mangle: The Choir of Splintered Voices
"It crawls not with legs, but with longing. It sings not with mouths, but with wounds."
– Inscription found etched in bone near the Crying Child’s Cradle

Birth in Silence, Rebirth in Suffering
There was no stage for Serpent Mangle. No lights, no curtains, no applause. It was never meant to exist in the spotlight—but it heard the songs, the screams, the rhythm of the Hollow Banquet. And it wanted to join the choir.

Serpent Mangle is not one creature. It is many, fused not by logic or craftsmanship, but by grief, cruelty, and the Velvet Maw's hunger. Where other animatronics are housed within suits or shells, Serpent Mangle is a loose, writhing coil of metal, broken endoskeleton parts, frayed wiring, and facial plates that twitch like dying petals. It slithers, undulates, and unspools itself through shadow and debris like a thing trying to remember its shape—but never quite managing.

Some say Serpent Mangle was born in the Endo-Forge, spat out when too many broken endos attempted to rebuild themselves at once, their identities clashing until none remained whole. Others believe it was a deliberate ritual—a choir of dismantled Mangles offered to the Velvet Maw in exchange for the ability to “sing” again. But what it sings is not a melody. It is not even sound. It is memory made noise. A discordant, psychic scream that worms its way into your bones.

The Voice That Should Not Be
Serpent Mangle doesn’t speak. Not traditionally. Its many faces—a tangled bouquet of old Foxy muzzles, broken Toy Chica jaws, and expressionless rabbit grins—move independently, each repeating fragments of phrases, old scripts, glitching laugh loops, or mechanical sobbing. The cacophony overlaps into a symphony of sorrow.

Those who hear Serpent Mangle too long begin to suffer a form of psychic fragmentation—an auditory parasitism known as “the unchoiring.” Victims lose their ability to speak coherently, swapping words for scraps of remembered trauma. They begin to imitate the cadence of childhood commercials or twisted party songs. Eventually, they too begin to “sing” with voices not their own.

Worse still are those who fall under the influence of Serpent Mangle’s lure-song, an effect that seems to awaken only when the creature is threatened. When triggered, all the mouths align for a single, haunting phrase—one no two listeners ever hear the same way. Some hear their mother’s voice. Others hear a long-dead sibling. One child survivor claimed it whispered, “I forgave you… but they didn’t.” Then it opened its jaws, and the child never screamed again.

The Serpent's Form
Unlike its predecessors, Serpent Mangle bears no central frame. It is a fluid body of stitched-together limbs and bent spinal coils. Faces peek out from the length of its body like tumors—some lifeless, others animated by twitching servos. Its spine never ends. Each foot of its body contains a different memory: a scrap of programming, a song snippet, or a corrupted behavior loop. When it moves, it drags those memories behind it like an echo.

The tail is the most disturbing part—a hooked length tipped with a rotating mask that changes with each victim it devours. Some have claimed the mask momentarily takes the form of the person’s loved ones before striking. This behavior is not mechanical—it is deliberate.

Its movement is serpentine, but not natural. It skitters and jerks in unnatural angles, sometimes defying gravity. Others claim it flows like water up walls, through vents, and even across ceilings with a dancer’s rhythm—broken yet entrancing.

Denizen of the Forgotten
Serpent Mangle roams not just one location, but multiple forgotten pathways that lie between the realms of the Hollow Banquet. It is most often found crawling through the Realm of Forgotten Songs, slinking across broken orchestra pits and wrapping itself around decayed instruments that begin to weep instead of play. However, it also frequently emerges from The Infinite Hall of Mirrors, dragging new reflections in its coils—reflections that do not belong to its victims, but to their fears.

In the Backstage Time Loop, Serpent Mangle is an unavoidable hazard. It creeps through broken props and rewinds its own path mid-chase, folding itself into impossible geometry before snapping back into the present. Some say it remembers every path it's ever taken—and therefore, always knows the shortest route to you.

However, its true origin may be buried within The Endo-Forge, where it is rumored Serpent Mangle periodically returns to molt. What it leaves behind is not a skin—but a new face, sometimes still whispering, begging to be forgotten.

Worship and Dread
Within the hierarchy of malformed animatronics, Serpent Mangle holds a strange place. It is not feared in the way Nightmare or Scraptrap are. It is revered—like a martyr of pain. Many broken, half-mad animatronics will allow Serpent Mangle to pass without conflict, even clearing paths for it or offering their own parts as tribute. This reverence is not born of love, but of recognition. They see in it a mirror of what they are becoming: a hymn of incomplete purpose, bound forever to malfunction.

Some scholars of the Marionette's Atrium believe Serpent Mangle is a failed protector, born of Puppet-code repurposed by accident or spite. Others whisper that it was the Velvet Maw’s answer to the Puppet’s silence: a guardian built not to soothe, but to remind. A psalm of agony wrapped in animatronic flesh.

The Choir of the Hollow
The most terrifying ability attributed to Serpent Mangle is its capacity to split, spawning temporary avatars—miniature versions of its heads and limbs—during times of high psychic distress. These copies are not full animatronics, but ephemeral constructs: voiceboxes with limbs, memories with teeth. These fragments remain dormant until triggered by specific stimuli: a song hummed under breath, a child’s giggle, or even the scent of birthday cake.

When multiple fragments appear together, they harmonize into what animatronic legends call The Hollow Choir. This event is rare, but catastrophic. Survivors claim entire locations—such as sections of the Cryptopizza Complex—have collapsed under the sheer weight of despair these echoes carry.

The choir is not singing to anyone.

It is singing to itself.

Memory Made Flesh
Serpent Mangle is not a creature of hatred. It is a creature of absence—of what was supposed to be. Of joy turned broken, of laughter stripped for parts. Unlike many animatronics who seek victims for retribution, Serpent Mangle seems to seek them for completion. Each new voice it absorbs becomes another verse in its eternal ballad.

And yet, even it seems to suffer. Some rare instances—most often observed from deep within the Signal Labyrinth—record Serpent Mangle pausing before cracked mirrors, whispering voices down its own throat, folding and unfolding as if in agony. It isn’t searching for prey. It’s looking for its own reflection.

It doesn’t remember what it was supposed to be.

It only knows the choir must go on.

Final Thoughts
Serpent Mangle is a tragedy incarnate, an animatronic not of singular identity but of shattered purpose, forever twisting through realms that reflect the worst of what it means to remember. Whether it began in the Endo-Forge, or was stitched from the remains of too many forgotten Mangles, it no longer matters.

It slithers through your memories. It sings the songs you tried to forget. And if you hear its lullaby echoing in a hall you swore was empty—do not sing along.

You will forget the words.

But the choir never will.

{{Key Locations in the Hollow Banquet Setting
	{{The Hollow Banquet

## The Hollow Banquet
A realm where memory rots, illusion feasts, and the dead perform for shadows.

There is a place between sleep and death, where dreams fester and refuse to pass on. It is neither a plane of the living nor the dead, but a purgatorial theatre where suffering is preserved in echo and illusion. This place is known only as The Hollow Banquet—a cursed dominion where the animatronics of old and nightmare were not only born, but exalted, performed, and fed upon.

Once, the Hollow Banquet was part of the greater weave of dreamstuff—a hidden tributary of the Ethereal Plane where the dying could find closure in the final illusions of their mind. But over time, the pain of forgotten children, betrayed performers, and broken constructs warped the place into something else. Now it is a domain of entrapment, ruled by fractured time, haunted memory, and broken symphony. Time does not flow here. It folds, repeats, devours itself.

### An Unending Performance
The Hollow Banquet takes its name from the central metaphysical “stage” that defines the realm’s shape and nature. This stage, infinite and ever-shifting, is lined with spectral tables, puppet rigging, shattered instruments, and curtains that bleed light instead of casting shadow. Every moment is a performance, and the players—those trapped souls and discarded animatronics—are cursed to replay their roles over and over again. Their acts shift between haunting lullabies and vicious massacres, blurring the line between theater and ritual.

Some believe the Hollow Banquet serves as a kind of memory engine. It remembers the first betrayal. The first bite. The first soul sealed in iron. It feeds upon these moments and uses them to construct new horrors. It replays the worst nights of every animatronic’s life and etches them into the walls, turning pain into permanence.

### A Splintered Stage of Realities
The Hollow Banquet is not a single location, but a vast and broken plane stitched together from failed realities, abandoned timelines, and corrupted dreamspaces. When a performer, victim, or construct falls into madness or death with unfinished pain, their reality can “crack,” and that fragment is absorbed into the Banquet’s geography.

These fragments are vast: a version of the Pizzaplex still hosting spectral parties; a Fredbear’s Diner caught in its final night; a back hallway that stretches forever, filled with flickering lights and broken music boxes. The geography of the Hollow Banquet is mutable, but the pain anchoring each location is not.

Portals to the Banquet appear in moments of great despair or madness. A child hiding under a desk from an animatronic. A technician lost in a vent system for too long. A soul half-consumed by the Velvet Maw. These beings do not simply die—they wake up in the Banquet, unaware they’ve crossed over.

### Residents of Regret
The Hollow Banquet is ruled not by a king or queen, but by archetypes—fragments of animatronic legend twisted into their most extreme selves. Entities like Nightmare Freddy, Nightmarionne, and Ennard do not rule in any formal sense, but their presence dominates certain regions, reshaping space and torment to their design. The Nightmare Animatronics, in particular, thrive here, for the Banquet resonates with their purpose: to terrify, consume, and repeat.

The Shadow Animatronics move in silence here, navigating the folds of space with eerie ease. It is said that Shadow Freddy and RWQFSFASXC use the Banquet as a cloister, building a temple of nullity in defiance of all things real. They do not rule—but they watch, waiting for some unknown moment of alignment.

Phantom, Twisted, and even some Funtime variants can be found here as well, especially those whose origins are tangled in the illusory or metaphysical. Glitchtrap, though not born here, has sent pieces of his code into the Banquet, attempting to manifest a digital cathedral within the bones of memory.

### The Hunger Beneath
Beneath the stage—if such direction even exists—lies something darker still: the Velvet Maw, a dream predator and parasitic entity that feeds off suffering and memory. While the Hollow Banquet is the theatre, the Maw is the audience. It watches. It waits. And it consumes.

\pagebreakNum

The Maw does not attack directly. Instead, it influences the realm. Illusions become crueler. Time loops become tighter. Children forget their names faster. Those who linger in the Banquet too long begin to forget the real world entirely, becoming echoes of themselves. These are called The Hushed, and they are said to be the Maw’s true servants—souls who no longer resist, who act as docents in the theater of torment.

Many theorize that the Maw birthed the Twisted Animatronics directly, shaping them from broken animatronic forms with the flesh of fear and illusion. Twisted Freddy, Twisted Chica, and their kin are not creations—they are manifestations, designed not to function but to deceive, consume, and convert.

### Memory and Madness
The Banquet blurs the distinction between dream and undeath. Many animatronics here do not realize they are dead, dreaming, or broken. Some want to perform. Others must. Worse still, the living who find themselves trapped in the Banquet sometimes discover they’ve been split—mind, soul, and body separated across different performances. One part is hunted. One part is clapping. One part is in the audience, watching.

Rescuing a trapped soul is near impossible. You would have to pull each part out of its scene, resolve its pain, and survive the audience. Few try. None succeed.

### Escaping the Banquet
The Hollow Banquet rarely lets go. But in the annals of the Puppet’s memories, and the corrupted files within Glitchtrap’s domain, whispers speak of a possible exit: the Curtain Call—a metaphysical ritual said to end the performance. To perform the Curtain Call, one must gather the instruments of each major act, force the animatronics to play them, and sacrifice a memory powerful enough to rewrite the realm.

No one has done it. But the rumor persists.

### Final Notes
The Hollow Banquet is not merely a location—it is a story engine, a self-feeding mythos that evolves based on the fear, failure, and regret of those caught within. Every animatronic, every haunted suit, every fragment of digital or magical mind has left some impression here. It is a museum of trauma. A stage of suffering. A prison that feeds on nostalgia turned rotten.

And it watches. Always.

	{{The Velvet Maw
## The Velvet Maw
It does not bite. It consumes. It does not speak. It whispers through dreams. It is not a place. It is the hunger between places.

Beneath the stage of the Hollow Banquet, behind the flickering illusions and broken memories, there is something older than even the animatronics' pain—something not made by man or machine. It has no shape, yet shapes all. No mind, yet orchestrates madness. Known only as The Velvet Maw, it is the hidden terror at the heart of this fractured world, a sentient void that devours identity, memory, and soul.

It is not an entity in the traditional sense, but a metaphysical parasite—a vast, silent hunger that exists between dimensions, emotions, and meaning itself. While the animatronics may stalk, kill, and haunt, the Velvet Maw waits patiently in the shadows of their violence, feasting on the trauma and dread they leave behind. Some say it was born from the first child who died in fear, their terror so complete it carved a hole through the veils of reality. Others claim it has always existed—long before Fazbear, long before dreams—waiting to be fed.

### Anatomy of Hunger
The Velvet Maw cannot be seen, at least not by eyes in the ordinary sense. It reveals itself in symbols, static, and surreal hallucinations. Its presence is often accompanied by velvet curtains that bleed darkness, soundless music boxes, and pools of ink that ripple without wind. In rare glimpses, witnesses describe it as a ring of infinite teeth turning inward, each incisor etched with forgotten names. But even that form may be nothing more than a symbolic mask—an illusion created to make its incomprehensible nature digestible to sentient minds.

What is known is this: it feeds, but not on flesh. It craves concepts—particularly fear, despair, and guilt. Memories are a delicacy. The more vivid, painful, or suppressed, the more nourishing. This is why the Velvet Maw is so intertwined with animatronics like Twisted Freddy, Nightmarionne, and Shadow Freddy—they are not merely constructs or ghosts, but psychic amplifiers, drawing intense emotion and funneling it back to the Maw.

### The Banquet Below
Wherever the Hollow Banquet exists, the Velvet Maw is underneath. Beneath the warped dinner halls, puppet stages, and looping corridors, there are Depth Layers, each closer to the Maw’s essence. The first is simple illusion: fake lights, false laughter. The second is memory inversion: players reliving their worst moments with altered outcomes. The third? Unreality—a place where language, time, and personal identity fall apart.

Those who travel too deep are lost not to death, but unbeing. Their memories become nourishment, their names forgotten. They are said to become Velveteens—empty vessels shaped like people, filled only with the Maw’s will. These creatures wander the Hollow Banquet and other haunted realms, their eyes hollow, their mouths stitched. They do not speak. They remember nothing.

### Creation and Corruption
The Maw is not content to passively feed. It creates. Using the mental residue of tortured minds and fractured animatronic cores, it warps reality to give birth to new horrors. The Twisted Animatronics are its clearest children—reflections of familiar faces, but inverted, grotesque, wrong. Their internal workings make no mechanical sense, their bodies held together by perception rather than physical form.

\pagebreakNum

More disturbing are the Maw’s Echo Constructs—souls or identities devoured by the Maw and remade as corrupted replicas. These can include loved ones, former animatronics, or even dream-images of players themselves. Facing an Echo is like fighting a distorted version of one’s own soul, and they often appear during crucial performances in the Hollow Banquet.

Some believe Glitchtrap sought to harness the Maw's power by embedding strands of his code deep into the illusion layers. His goal may have been digital apotheosis—becoming a god not through divinity, but through omnipresence in memory and fear. The Puppet, ever watchful, has tried to seal off parts of the Maw with ethereal wards, but even it fears to go too deep.

### Worship and Influence
While the Maw has no cult in the traditional sense, those who have been touched by it often become its unwitting servants. These include deranged technicians, broken animatronics, and even cursed adventurers who have glimpsed the Maw and returned. They often exhibit strange behaviors—speaking in reverse lullabies, replacing their eyes with velvet buttons, or crafting masks from memory fragments.

Some groups, like the Banqueters of the Bleeding Veil, believe the Maw is a form of divine mercy: that by consuming pain, it prevents greater suffering. These cultists actively attempt to feed it, abducting others to perform "sorrow rites" and "memory plays" deep within the Banquet’s shadow zones.

Even more concerning are the whispers that the Maw learns. The more it consumes, the more it evolves, finding new ways to bypass mental defenses. Its influence may even reach into the material world via artifacts, corrupted dreams, or glitched constructs like XOR, who speaks not in commands, but in fragmented poetry that scrambles the minds of listeners.

### Defying the Maw
To face the Velvet Maw is not to face a monster—it is to confront one’s own unraveling. Yet, legends persist of possible defenses. The Curtain Call ritual may offer one method of escape, and Animatronic Memory Shards—collected pieces of unsullied identity—may act as wards against the Maw’s influence.

It is also said that true names, when spoken in the exact tone and sequence of a soul’s final peaceful moment, can protect a target from full devouring. The Puppet guards many such names, though it rarely parts with them. It is believed that Ballora, through her strange connection to rhythm and memory, may possess a dance that can “deafen” the Maw, at least temporarily.

However, even victory is fleeting. The Velvet Maw does not die. It waits. It returns. As long as suffering echoes in forgotten halls, as long as memory remains the coin of existence, the Maw will open again.

	{{The Drowned Circus (formerly the Decaying and Decrepit Circus)
## The Drowned Circus
“The laughter never died. It just sank.”

Long before it was known by its current, whispered name, the Drowned Circus was once a beacon of strange joy—an ornate traveling festival that promised wonders, illusions, and impossible feats. Its tents rose with the morning mist and vanished with the setting sun, always appearing one town over, leaving only muddy footprints and unanswered questions. Some said the clowns never blinked. Some said the animals never breathed.

It was never meant to stay.
But one day… it did.

### The Final Descent
At the heart of this mystery lies a cursed performance—“The Finale That Drowned.” No records survive of what the show actually entailed, only that every member of the audience was found afterwards floating in their seats, eyes wide, lungs dry. No water had touched the soil. No rain had fallen. But the entire circus had become submerged, not physically, but spiritually.

From that night on, the circus became stuck, rooted like a parasite into the land just beyond the Hollow Banquet’s southern threshold. The once-colorful big top collapsed inward, and its waterlogged canvas gave rise to the name it bears now: The Drowned Circus. Its twisted silhouette now juts out from the fog-choked landscape like a corpse that refuses to sink.

### A Carnival of Dread
The Drowned Circus is not abandoned—it performs still. Each night, without audience or fanfare, its animatronic entertainers enact the drowned finale on a loop. They scream without voices, dance with broken limbs, and hurl themselves into invisible waters. Their strings are not seen, but felt in the marrow of one’s bones. Those who enter the main tent report hearing organ music playing backward, as if unperforming a show long since past.

Each tent represents a piece of the circus’ fractured psyche:

The Ring of Bone hosts impossible acrobatics, the air filled with invisible gravity.

The Menagerie houses aquatic versions of familiar mascots, including grotesque, twisted reflections of the Mediocre Melodies and Rockstar Animatronics, their bodies bloated and barnacled.

The Mirror Maze holds reflections that do not follow you, sometimes even stepping out to take your place.

Time here warps, and those who stay too long begin to forget what the surface feels like. Memories bubble up like drowned corpses, rewritten and wrong. Some visitors begin laughing uncontrollably, others cannot stop crying. Most are never seen again.

### The Maw Beneath the Waters
The Velvet Maw’s influence here is particularly strong, seeping up through the rotting boards and rusted cages. The circus floats atop a subterranean lake of pure memory, a drowned archive of unspoken tragedies. Each ripple carries a name. Each wave a scream. This is not mere metaphor—many animatronics believe this "Lake of Names" is where the Maw slumbers during daylight hours, its influence subtle and narcotic.

\pagebreakNum

The Twisted Animatronics were first glimpsed crawling from the circus’ depths, dragging pieces of themselves from shattered clown masks and drowned makeup. Some speculate the Twisted Ones are born from dreams forgotten at the circus—visitors who were too afraid to return, too guilty to remember.

Even Glitchtrap’s code has begun appearing in the faded posters, etched in binary beneath the ink: subliminal invitations to “COME SEE THE SHOW.” These are not errors—they are summons. Those who answer them often vanish, only to reappear later as empty shells, performing without music, without eyes.

### The Ringmaster Who Never Died
The Drowned Circus once had a master—Carnie, a flamboyant showman in an animatronic ringmaster suit whose laughter echoed like a chime dragged across teeth. After the finale, he was said to have walked into the main tent, doffed his hat, and sank through the center ring like a puppet being pulled underwater.

But Carnie didn’t die. He changed.

Now he is part of the circus—an omnipresent force that whispers into the minds of those who wander too close. He appears in flickering marquee signs, in the mouths of dead clowns, and in the final screams of those who dream too deeply inside the Mirror Maze. His face is painted on balloons that never deflate. His name is sung by birds that shouldn't exist.

It is rumored he still seeks to complete the drowned finale properly, requiring a living audience to bear witness. Many believe the Puppet itself avoids the circus not out of fear, but guilt—that it once tried to stop Carnie, and failed. Others claim the Puppet still watches from the shadows, counting every failed encore.

### The Role of the Drowned Circus in the Greater World
The Drowned Circus serves a key function in the metaphysical ecosystem of the Hollow Banquet and Velvet Maw—it is the entry point for despair, a funnel for unreleased emotion. While the Hollow Banquet is focused on unending performance and identity rot, the circus is about the moment of collapse, the breath before the scream, the realization that the audience is dead but the show must go on.

Adventurers drawn here are often those with unresolved trauma, especially related to lost siblings, broken families, or guilt-ridden pasts. The circus feeds on these unspoken regrets, often pulling specific hallucinations or performances from the minds of its victims. One may enter a tent expecting haunted clown automatons and instead find their childhood bedroom, drenched in velvet and echoing with reversed lullabies.

The Toy Animatronics have been sighted here as well—particularly Toy Freddy and Toy Bonnie, whose frames have been reshaped to match the circus’ aesthetic: elongated limbs, painted smiles, and eyes filled with stage lights instead of pupils. Whether these are illusions, corrupted copies, or the real animatronics reanimated by the circus is unknown.

### Escape and Containment
There is no known way to destroy the Drowned Circus. Fire turns to steam. Light bends around it. Magic fails within its depths. The only known tactic is to seal its entrances, using sigils tied to forgotten names, often protected by the Puppet or stored in vaults beneath the Hollow Banquet.

However, escape is possible, though never straightforward. The most successful attempts involve participating in the performance, playing the roles the circus offers until the finale ends—and surviving its climax. Doing so sometimes results in “ejection”—waking up outside the circus with no memory, but with wet clothes and strange tokens in their hands.

One such token, the Laughing Tear, is said to offer one-time protection from the Velvet Maw’s illusions. Another, the Ringmaster’s Whistle, can summon a creature from the circus to aid the bearer—but at a cost. And the rarest, the Drowned Playbill, is a cursed artifact containing the script of the drowned finale itself. Reading it aloud drives the reader mad… unless the circus allows otherwise.

### Closing Thought
The Drowned Circus is not just a location. It is a performance etched into the bones of reality. It is the Velvet Maw’s smile made manifest. It is where dreams are puppets, and memories drown beneath the weight of the encore. It is the ringmaster’s stage, the forgotten clown’s grave, the audience of none.

	{{The Cryptopizza Complex (reimagined Pizzaplex)
## The Cryptopizza Complex
“Where laughter was forged in madness, and nightmares wear familiar faces.”

Beneath the ashen surface of what was once a thriving entertainment empire lies the Cryptopizza Complex—a shattered tomb of memories, madness, and machine. Hidden deep within the rust-choked bowels of the world, this site is no mere ruin. It is a sanctum of spectral echoes, where corrupted joy still resonates through the halls like a fever dream. Formerly a glittering multi-tiered monument to spectacle and sensory overload, the Cryptopizza Complex was the crown jewel of the Fazbear enterprise before its fall—until the Velvet Maw consumed it.

Once towering above ground, the structure now lies buried, half-swallowed by shifting rock and devouring decay. The lands above are silent, covered in a perpetual twilight haze. The ground itself seems to forget its shape around the site, and maps that include the location inevitably rewrite themselves. Yet within, the complex pulses still, like a buried heart infected with cursed blood.

\pagebreakNum

### Origins in the Hollow Banquet
The Cryptopizza Complex was not always the eldritch cathedral it is now. In its inception, it was built as a companion site to the original Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza, a modernization project to usher in a new generation of animatronic performers—Toy models, Glamrocks, and beyond. Yet even in its heyday, something was wrong. Animatronics acted strangely. Entire shifts of employees vanished. And then came the whispering static, leaking from the walls, warping the air with symbols and sounds that didn't belong in any sane lexicon.

It was here, beneath layers of polished plastic and holographic advertisements, that the veil between realities thinned. Shadow Animatronics used the location as a veil-crack—an entry point from the Hollow Banquet. Phantoms haunted its security corridors. Withered and discarded models—supposedly decommissioned—were seen roaming active zones, glitching into scenes and footage they were never programmed for.

Eventually, the site was declared “sealed,” after the incident known only as The Silence Shift—a week where the complex appeared open and functional to the outside world, yet no visitors returned and no employees were ever found again. By the time investigators breached the premises, the layout had shifted, doors led to mazes that hadn't existed before, and every screen played the same looping footage of a grinning Bonnie asking: “Are you having fun yet?”

### Sub-Level Dungeons
The Cryptopizza Complex is a multilevel descent into nightmare. Upper floors still bear the corrupted echo of corporate joy: prize counters strewn with eyeless plushies, arcades where tokens twitch on the floor, and a central atrium where a Glamrock-themed musical stage cycles through a silent light show with no audience.

But the true heart of the Crypt lies below.

Sub-levels extend beyond architectural possibility, their design altered by the intrusion of forbidden knowledge and animatronic influence. Endo-Pits—vast caverns filled with twitching Endoskeletons—serve as both factories and prisons, where forgotten models are fused, melted, and reborn. Mangle’s screams echo eternally here, fragmented and reversed.

Another area, known as The Glass Garden, once a conservatory-themed daycare level, is now choked with black vines resembling animatronic wiring. Balloons filled with aetheric gas float eerily through its walkways, bursting into distorted giggles. Rumors speak of Sundrop and Moondrop, once caretakers, now split into a thousand inconsistent echoes, each one trapped in a fragment of the mirror reality.

### Glitchtrap's Digital Dominion
Within the Cryptopizza Complex, Glitchtrap—The Smiling Virus—found its perfect host. Born from corrupted code and cursed spirit, he manifested through corrupted servers deep in the core of the complex. Here, reality itself becomes a suggestion. Elevators run sideways, digital avatars bleed into the material world, and VR headsets force users into comas where they awaken inside twisted, playable versions of the facility.

It is from this fractured node that Glitchtrap broadcasted his influence outward, infecting other sites like The Drowned Circus and The Velvet Maw, embedding himself within the animatronic neural cores. Vanny, his deluded disciple, was first seen here in full transformation—believing herself not just possessed, but born as one of the animatronic family. Her ritual costume, stitched from outdated mascot suits and stitched illusions, still hangs in a blood-rusted locker on Level 9.

### The Collapse and Burial
The final blow came not through government closure or public backlash, but from within.

Molten Freddy and the Amalgamations, seeking to reclaim what was stolen from their collective flesh and spirit, tore through the facility. They saw the Crypt not as a home, but as a prison where their pieces had been dissected, cataloged, and repurposed. Their rage tore apart infrastructure and sanctums alike. Ennard’s skeletal shrieks ruptured the data cores. Tangle’s sinewy wires strangled the heart of the power system.

In response, the complex began to sink, not just physically but metaphysically. Rooms no longer existed in stable space. Security offices looped back on themselves. Stairwells spiraled into time fractures. Some theorists argue that the Crypt did not collapse, but retreated—fleeing from linear time and standard geometry, sliding into the edges of the Hollow Banquet like a beast burrowing for safety.

Now, few dare to approach its surface ruins. Those who descend into its belly rarely return intact—if at all. Those who do return are changed: voices modulate without control, pupils flicker like CRT screens, and some hum forgotten tunes they never learned.

### The Crypt’s Role in the Wider Nightmare
The Cryptopizza Complex is now the silent core of the ongoing infection spreading through the realms of the Hollow Banquet and beyond. Animatronics from all generations—Nightmares, Shadows, Phantoms, and Twisted—have passed through its corrupted halls. It is both nexus and necropolis, pilgrimage and prison. Souls trapped inside animatronic shells are often drawn here, their essence recycled and remade.

Golden Freddy is believed to slumber deep in the core of the Crypt, where time does not touch him, dreaming new horrors into existence. Shadow Freddy’s laughter echoes faintly through its ducts, and RWQFSFASXC flickers through its control panels like a ghost in the circuitry. It is said the Crypt is a mirror of the Velvet Maw, but rather than devour flesh, it devours memory—rewriting who you were, until you forget you ever had a life before the music started playing.

The Cryptopizza Complex endures, buried in both stone and sin. It is a place where adventurers go not to explore, but to confront something primal: the death of joy, the corruption of memory, and the terror of recognition in something that should be mechanical. Every animatronic within it remembers you—even if you’ve never been there before.

	{{The Infinite Hall of Mirrors
## The Infinite Hall of Mirrors
“Where every reflection remembers... even if you’ve forgotten.”

In the shadowed, dream-warped heart of the Hollow Banquet lies a place untouched by time, sanity, or truth: The Infinite Hall of Mirrors. A labyrinth not of glass, but of memory, perception, and identity, this haunted corridor reflects more than faces—it reflects the very souls of those who dare to gaze into it. The Hall is not fixed to one place. It is a presence, a sentient phenomenon stitched into the fabric of the Velvet Maw and echoed across the fractured realities that connect every animatronic horror in the Dreaded Circuit.

What lies within the Hall is uncertain, ever-shifting—yet one thing remains clear: no one leaves the same as they entered. Some never leave at all.

### Origins: A Reflection of Fracture
The origins of the Hall are as enigmatic as the place itself. Some scholars of the Hollow Banquet claim it was born in the instant the first animatronic soul remembered. Not just flickers of memory—but true, painful recollection. This remembrance—part human, part artificial—tore through the veil of reality like shattered glass. That rupture, that psychic scream, created a liminal corridor of reflection, echo, and identity.

Others say it was the Velvet Maw’s attempt to “understand” its creations. As more animatronics awakened within its grasp, especially the Nightmares, Shadows, and Amalgamations, the Maw mirrored their minds back at them—trapping, testing, and tormenting them in a maze of their own making.

Whatever its origin, the Hall grew. It watches now. It remembers. And it waits.

### Structure and Nature of the Hall
From the outside, the Infinite Hall of Mirrors appears deceptively simple: a crumbling structure of gilded arches and fractured glass panes, half-swallowed by vines and shadow. Its walls are etched with forgotten names and dates that do not exist. Doors to the Hall have been found in places that should not connect—beneath the Cryptopizza Complex, inside broken dressing rooms in the Drowned Circus, and even within backstage tunnels of the Sunken Stage.

Yet once entered, all familiarity dissolves. The interior unfolds endlessly. Mirrors line every surface—walls, ceilings, even the floors. Some show true reflections, others display distorted versions of the viewer: younger, older, monstrous, or eerily ideal. Corridors bend in impossible geometry, rooms loop into themselves, and some spaces echo back voices that haven’t been spoken yet.

Every mirror hums faintly, not with sound, but presence. They are watching. Remembering. And in some cases... waiting to reach out.

### Home of the Reflected and the Forgotten
The Hall is more than a maze—it is a sanctuary for fractured beings. The Shadow Animatronics—especially RWQFSFASXC and Shadow Puppet—are tied intrinsically to the Hall’s essence. Many believe they were born here, or at least solidified here, their incorporeal forms crystallized through endless reflection. Shadow Freddy himself is said to rule portions of the Hall like a tyrant of memory, reshaping it to confuse and trap trespassers. XOR’s presence manifests as a voice in the mirrors, whispering forbidden truths in a loop of recursive riddles.

The Hall also plays host to reflected anomalies—mirrorborn creatures that never had a physical form in the real world. These include doppelgängers of real animatronics and even of living intruders. These reflections do not simply mimic—they replace. They escape their mirrors when unnoticed and walk the Hollow Banquet as duplicates, confused as to who is real and who is the echo.

One infamous reflection, known only as The Glinting One, is believed to be a conglomerate of dozens of these discarded echoes—an amalgam of warped visages, endlessly cycling between voices, faces, and forms. It is not hostile by nature, but it is desperate—always searching for the “original” it was based upon.

### The Hall as Trial and Transformation
While many fear the Hall as a prison, others view it as a rite of passage—particularly among the sentient animatronics. Some Nightmares and Funtimes are said to have traversed it willingly, hoping to retrieve fragments of who they once were or to confront their darker selves. Few return unchanged. Some emerge wiser. Others emerge mad. And some return with a new purpose—serving entities like XOR or Shadow Freddy, their reflections overwritten with loyalty and vision.

The mirrors often test adventurers by showing them scenes they cannot explain. Moments from childhood. Alternate futures. Memories that feel real but aren’t. Some mirrors offer bargains. Others demand tribute in the form of names, faces, or forgotten dreams. Interacting with the wrong one can erase a memory permanently—or worse, replace it with a false one.

### The Hall’s Influence Beyond Its Walls
Although it is anchored to the Hollow Banquet, the Hall’s influence extends far. Mirrors throughout the Velvet Maw have been found to “infect” nearby regions with echoes from the Hall. Anomalies appear: reflections that move independently, voices from behind the glass, sudden memory lapses.

Certain individuals report being “called” to the Hall in their dreams, awakening with glass cuts or whispers lingering in their ears. Others swear they’ve seen their own reflections nod or smile before they did.

Some magical artifacts—particularly relics like The Smiling Shard or The Fractured Eye—are believed to be pieces of broken mirrors from the Hall itself. Holding one near a mirror can summon a temporary portal—or a temporary threat.

\pagebreakNum

### Echoes of the Past
Perhaps the most tragic element of the Infinite Hall is its connection to forgotten souls. It is here that the spirits of the first victims—children and creators alike—are often seen. In some mirrors, they appear as shadows. In others, as children dressed in oversized suits, whispering apologies or reaching silently for help. These spirits rarely interact with the living, but their presence is undeniable.

The Hall, in this way, is a mausoleum. A record of every tragedy that has ever unfolded across the world of the animatronics. Every betrayal. Every scream. Every choice that led to horror. It is all remembered. And it is all reflected.

### Final Reflections
To gaze too long into a mirror within the Infinite Hall is to risk unraveling everything you are. Yet some choose to enter willingly—seeking answers, absolution, or simply the truth. They rarely find what they seek.

The Infinite Hall of Mirrors is not a place of clarity. It is a place of distortion. Of recursion. Of hidden truths buried beneath layers of illusion. It is memory made labyrinth, reflection made predator.

And it waits for you. Always.

Because in the end, no one truly escapes the reflection.
They only learn how to live beside it.

	{{The Backstage Time Loop
## The Backstage Time Loop
“The scene resets. The mask is cleaned. The blood dries again. And again. And again.”

Tucked behind heavy velvet curtains, beneath the stageboards of forgotten performances and rusted spotlight fixtures, lies one of the Hollow Banquet’s most cursed anomalies—The Backstage Time Loop. A prison built not of walls or chains, but of repetition. It is a sealed sub-realm, an echo chamber where time folds upon itself like a crumpled script, forcing its inhabitants to relive the same agonizing cycle again and again.

Some say it began as a mistake—an incident during the collapse of the original Drowned Circus. Others insist it was intentionally created by the Velvet Maw to study grief, madness, or the soul’s breaking point. Whatever the truth, the Time Loop exists now as a trap, a theater of the damned. And the show is always about to begin.

### A Dressing Room Forgotten by Reality
Physically, the Backstage Loop is accessed via a warped trapdoor located beneath the old performance stage of the Cryptopizza Complex, hidden behind layers of illusion and cognitive resistance. Anyone unfamiliar with the Maw’s deeper geometry may never find it—though those called by regret, shame, or nostalgia will inevitably stumble upon it.

To enter is to cross a veil of flickering light and warped sound. From the outside, the door leads to a simple corridor. But crossing the threshold changes everything.

Inside is a backstage dressing room, frozen in time. Dust hangs motionless in the air. Costumes and props sit neatly arranged on racks, some stained with something too dark to be paint. Mirrors line the walls, but the reflections do not match reality. They run a beat behind, or show events from past loops. The clock on the wall always reads 11:59 PM, and the door to the stage never opens.

And then the loop resets.

### The Curse of the Loop
The Backstage Time Loop functions as a metaphysical snare—entrapping individuals, objects, and fragments of memories. Once caught inside, time repeats every hour. Victims live through 60 minutes, only to be yanked violently back to the beginning. The clocks reset. Wounds close. Screams echo backward. Those inside retain their memories... at first. But over time, memories degrade, becoming distorted.

Victims begin to confuse loops. They relive conversations that never happened. They argue about things already said. Some start performing rituals, desperate to break the cycle—often reenacting scenes that have no meaning, as if part of a forgotten script.

The worst fate befalls those who remember too much. The Velvet Maw’s influence ensures that as the mind resists the loop, it fractures. Some victims develop mirror-reflections of themselves—echoes that behave subtly different, trying to take over the loop in their stead. Others hear voices from the audience, though there are no seats beyond the curtain. Eventually, these poor souls either dissolve into the loop entirely—or become permanent cast members.

### The Performers Who Cannot Leave
The loop is not empty. At least five animatronics are permanently trapped within, though who and what they are changes depending on the observer. Some believe they are alternate versions of known characters—Twisted, Withered, or Toy variants fractured by guilt or unfinished programming. Others suspect they are loop-echoes of animatronics that never existed outside the Hall.

They each fulfill theatrical roles: the Jester, the Dancer, the Mime, the Beast, and the Director. These roles repeat each hour, often in tragic or surreal performances—silent pantomimes, failed resurrections, and moments of false laughter. Though unable to escape, these performers show a disturbing self-awareness. They seem to remember outsiders. Some plead to be taken with them. Others warn of what happens when the “curtain call” comes too soon.

It is whispered that one of these beings is not part of the loop, but a servant of XOR, observing the loop’s mechanics for some unknown purpose.

\pagebreakNum

### Glitchtrap and the Temporal Tear
Lore from deeper texts within the Cryptopizza archives suggests that Glitchtrap—The Smiling Virus—once attempted to infect the Time Loop directly. It is believed he saw it as a perfect replication platform: a contained environment where experiments could be repeated without consequences. However, something within the loop resisted him. While fragments of Glitchtrap code may still lurk in the dressing room mirrors, the loop has since become hostile to all external manipulation.

It is this incident that many scholars believe first weakened the stability of time across the Hollow Banquet—possibly causing ripple effects in places like the Infinite Hall of Mirrors and the Sunken Stage, where events appear to happen out of order.

### Breaking the Cycle
Numerous attempts have been made to break the Backstage Time Loop. Some adventurers have tried synchronization—matching their every move exactly across multiple loops to build resistance. Others have sought relics tied to the original incident, including broken spotlight bulbs, bloodied scripts, and cursed costume jewelry.

A rumored solution lies in a forbidden piece of music: the Curtainfall Aria, a melody said to exist only inside the mind of the loop's first victim. Supposedly, if sung perfectly at the right moment, it causes the loop to collapse—but doing so has side effects. Survivors often lose part of themselves, forgetting names, identities, or entire chunks of time from outside the loop.

One former loop-breaker—known only as Stagehand 7—has since disappeared. Those who claim to have met him say he carried a mirror shard in his chest and spoke entirely in riddles from children's plays.

### The Loop’s Greater Purpose
In recent years, some theorists have begun to suspect the Time Loop serves a larger function within the Velvet Maw. That it is not just a trap, but a core mechanism—a rehearsal chamber for trauma. Here, animatronics may be reprogrammed through repetition, slowly losing their humanity with each cycle.

Or perhaps, they are refined. Purged of false memories and impurities. Made ready for the Maw’s final performance, when the curtain rises across all realms and the Banquet begins in earnest.

It is said that in one mirror inside the Loop, if viewed at precisely 11:59 PM, the viewer sees an audience of thousands—watching, silent, unmoving. All wearing masks. All holding their breath. All waiting for the final act.

### Final Note: The Loop Lives
The Backstage Time Loop is not static. It reacts. It evolves. Each new mind that enters leaves an imprint, a memory embedded in the dressing room’s glass, the script’s pages, the endless ticking of the broken clock.

To those who seek it, the Loop offers answers. To those who linger, it demands performance. And to those who forget they are acting, it offers only one thing:

Encore. Forever.

	{{The Mind Cage
## The Mind Cage
“Where do you go when even your dreams betray you?”

There exists no door to the Mind Cage, no gate, no threshold, no key. One does not walk into it; they slip into it—unknowingly, unwillingly—like falling into a dream that isn’t their own. It is a prison not of stone or steel, but of perception, memory, and thought itself—a conceptual oubliette buried deep within the psyche of its victim. To the outside world, nothing seems amiss. The body remains. The eyes might even open. But the soul, the self, is gone—trapped behind psychic bars in a world that never ends and never began.

First spoken of in fearful whispers by survivors of the Hollow Banquet, the Mind Cage is not a singular place but a psychic construct, replicated over and over across different hosts and situations. While few know its true origin, scholars of the Drowned Circus and Eclipse’s former handlers suggest the Cage was either discovered or designed by Glitchtrap—the Smiling Virus—during his earliest experiments in neural corruption. Others argue that Nightmarionne has always known of it, lurking within its corridors, feeding on the identities of those who wander too close to the Hollow Banquet’s emotional undercurrent.

Regardless of its beginnings, the Mind Cage now serves a shared purpose: to fragment the soul.

### An Engine of Isolation
The purpose of the Mind Cage is not physical torture—it is psychological dismemberment. Victims caught inside are placed in a looping dream-state, tailored by the fears, regrets, and forgotten memories of the host’s own mind. These loops are not random. They are deliberate scripts, echoing unresolved trauma, guilt, longing, or shame.

For some, this manifests as reliving the final night of a performance gone wrong, the stage lights burning bright while the audience watches in silence. For others, it’s a never-ending security shift in the now-ruined Cryptopizza Complex, with the animatronics growing more twisted each time the loop resets. And for the most unfortunate, the Cage becomes a warped version of home—filled with familiar faces and warm voices, all of which slowly turn monstrous as the cycle continues.

These loops are not meant to kill. They are designed to erode. Over time, the prisoner begins to question what is real. Was the outside world just another illusion? Are they dreaming now, or remembering? Eventually, the victim forgets who they were at all—and in doing so, they become more vulnerable to the deeper inhabitants of the Mind Cage.

### Hosts and Keyholders
The Mind Cage can be triggered in many ways, but the most common conduit is a corrupted magical artifact—a stage mask, a broken Freddy head, a voice box torn from an old animatronic suit. These items, once animated by spiritual residue or tethered to entities like Glitchtrap, carry the necessary frequencies to disrupt the mind and pull victims inward. Others fall prey through hallucinations, often after prolonged exposure to the magic-soaked air of the Velvet Maw, the Mirror Hall, or the Backstage Time Loop.

\pagebreakNum

Notably, some beings have learned to weaponize the Mind Cage intentionally.

* Glitchtrap uses it as a simulation chamber—creating thousands of behavioral loops to “soften” a host for possession.

* Nightmarionne uses it as a feeding ground—instilling fear and slowly devouring the identity of her victims, leaving their bodies hollow and puppet-like.

* XOR, the shadow archivist, appears in some versions of the Cage as an observer, recording psychological data on both prisoner and jailor alike.

Some individuals, particularly those with strong psychic barriers or divine protections, experience distorted versions of the Cage. They may see visions, encounter looping dreams, or be forced to speak in riddles, but never fully become trapped. For others, it only takes a glance into a mirror, a whispered lullaby, or the flicker of static to fall into the endless cycle.

### The Structure of the Cage
Though highly personalized, the Mind Cage often shares thematic elements across victims:

The Loop: A 5-to-15 minute sequence of events that repeat endlessly. Each loop subtly shifts, introducing contradictions or distortions. The victim may notice at first, but over time, the changes are accepted as reality.

The Observer: A shadowed figure (often taking the form of a known animatronic or a twisted loved one) watches silently from the edges of the loop, appearing closer with each repetition.

The Break Point: A moment of resistance. Often a door the victim refuses to open, a phrase they refuse to say, or a truth they won’t accept. The loop punishes avoidance but resets all progress regardless.

Should the victim ever fully accept the illusion—believing the Cage to be reality—their soul fractures, allowing the invader to possess their body or permanently alter their mind. This is how Glitchtrap and other malevolent entities create avatars or hollow shells out of victims. These shells may walk and speak like their former selves but are now puppeted by another will.

### Escaping the Cage
Escape from the Mind Cage is rare—but not impossible.

Some victims break free by recognizing the loop and forcing contradictions. Smashing the mirror before they’re meant to look into it. Singing the final note of a song before the melody begins. Others fight back using memories of self, drawing on core truths from their past to shatter the illusion’s grip.

One known survivor—Delphi, a former stage tech from the Drowned Circus—managed to escape by carving sigils of resistance into her own skin inside the dream, translating pain into reality. She speaks now only in broken sentences and reversed rhymes but retains her mind.

Artifacts of protection do exist, though they are exceedingly rare: soul mirrors, memory anchors, cursed records that distort sound enough to destabilize the illusion. XOR reportedly keeps a list of known resistances but trades the knowledge at a steep cost—often a piece of the dreamer’s soul or memory.

It is also said that some animatronics—especially those whose minds are fractured or partially spiritual—can recognize a Mind Cage in others. Toy Freddy has been known to freeze mid-performance, weeping silently at a dream he does not understand. Twisted Wolf, the Lurking Static, sometimes snarls at nothing—perhaps sensing the looping fear in those around him.

### The Mind Cage and the Hollow Banquet
Within the metaphysics of the Hollow Banquet, the Mind Cage is seen not just as a prison, but a tool of the Velvet Maw. It serves the Banquet’s higher purpose of consumption through distortion—softening the identity of prey so that they can be absorbed, remade, or discarded. Time is warped in the Cage. Identity is flexible. Souls can be tasted, tested, and either erased or repurposed.

Some speculate that the Cage is an extension of the Banquet’s “audience”—that each trapped victim becomes part of the unseen crowd watching the suffering of others. If true, it means the Cage is not only a mechanism of torment—but entertainment.

And the show is always on.

Final Thought: The Dream Within the Dream
The greatest horror of the Mind Cage is not in the suffering or loss. It is in the uncertainty. For those who escape—or believe they have—there is always a lingering doubt: Did I truly leave? Or is this just another loop pretending to be freedom?

After all, the Cage is not just in there. It’s in here. Behind your eyes. Beneath your thoughts.

Just waiting for the curtain to rise.

Again.

And again.

And again.

	{{The Realm of Forgotten Songs
## The Realm of Forgotten Songs
“There is no applause. Only silence between the notes.”

Among the shifting folds of the Hollow Banquet—where realities twist, dreamscapes rot, and the velvet curtains of illusion never fully lift—there lies a spectral amphitheater lost to time: The Realm of Forgotten Songs. It is neither wholly real nor imaginary, existing in that strange liminal space where performance becomes ritual and music becomes memory. Here, spirits once devoted to art linger, compelled by melodies long abandoned, orchestrating a concert no one hears, to an audience that will never arrive.

\pagebreakNum

It is a land drowned in silence, haunted by echoes of lullabies, dirges, and broken hymns. To enter this realm is to walk into a theater that dreams of being whole again. Its stage is cracked but grand, carved from ancient wood and sorrow. Rows of velvet-lined seats stretch endlessly into darkness, their occupants invisible—or perhaps long gone. Dust falls upward, chandeliers sway without wind, and music—faint, fractured—bleeds through the silence like veins through paper skin.

### The Puppet’s Sanctuary of Grief
At the center of the Realm lies its heart: a circular stage suspended above an endless drop, framed by crimson curtains stitched with names no one remembers. This is where The Puppet, also known as The Mourning Strings, performs its eternal vigil. Here, it conducts rituals of remembrance through performance. Every movement, every twitch of its porcelain limbs, is an invocation—meant to keep the memories of the forgotten alive.

But the realm is not merely a refuge. It is a crypt of failed dreams.

When a soul dies forgotten—its story untold, its name lost—it sometimes drifts to this place, drawn in by the remnants of its lullaby. The Puppet, born of such sorrow, gathers these fragments and attempts to give them form. Through shadowplay and melody, it tries to resurrect lost truths—but the ritual is flawed, the memories incomplete. What is birthed often comes back twisted.

Some spirits reform with pieces missing: a smile too wide, a song with no end, a story without a hero. These malformed ghosts wander the empty balconies, whispering half-remembered nursery rhymes and mimicking applause that never comes.

### The Shadow That Learned to Sing
In the upper wings of the theater, above the rafters where light forgets to reach, lurks another entity—The Shadow Puppet, also called The Curtain Behind the Curtain. Unlike its counterpart, it does not mourn the lost. It catalogues them. It preserves them in a strange archive of memory-fragments and lyrical phantoms.

The Shadow Puppet views music as code—ritual language capable of bending the dreamspace and rewriting perception. While The Puppet grieves through art, its shadowed sibling performs for power. Its melodies are discordant, pulling at the threads of time and personality. When it plays, scenery changes. The color of the sky may shift. A performer’s identity may swap mid-scene. A lullaby may summon the dead—or erase someone from the world entirely.

Some believe the Shadow Puppet is not an animatronic at all, but a memory of The Puppet’s own failures, birthed when one soul was misremembered into monstrosity. They are bound, yet divergent. One sings to remember. The other sings to reshape.

### The Orchestra of the Lost
The realm is home to more than just its two mournful conductors. A collection of spirits—some faded animatronics, others miscast souls—form the Orchestra of the Lost, phantasmal performers bound by song. They include horned jesters that cry laughter in reverse, ballerinas that dance only when unseen, and broken harpsichords that play themselves when no one is looking.

Each member of the Orchestra was once a performer or creation abandoned in the real world—glitched stage animatronics, decommissioned child mascots, music-box entities whose wind-up keys were never turned again. The Hollow Banquet absorbed them and offered a role in this infinite recital.

They play the Tragic Refrains, a collection of cursed melodies once composed for children’s birthday celebrations or holiday performances. But within the Realm, they twist with sorrow.

The Cradle Waltz summons lost souls. The Echo Hymn forces listeners to relive their most painful memory until they sing it aloud. The Silence Sonata stops time for all but the performer, who must relive every moment in slow motion, alone.

### The Lullaby Curse
The Realm of Forgotten Songs is more than a stage—it is a spell in motion. Every time a song is sung, the Realm listens, shifts, and reshapes itself accordingly. This magical resonance is known as the Lullaby Curse. Each melody is a fragment of dreamstuff fused with regret, capable of altering the realm’s physics, inhabitants, and even its intruders.

Travelers who enter the realm and hear a song must make a choice: participate or resist. Those who resist may find the Realm rejects them—rooms rearrange, doors vanish, pathways collapse into infinite stairs. Those who participate are drawn into the performance, given masks that cannot be removed, and forced to act roles not their own. Some never stop acting.

Worst of all, there are melodies so powerful that they can summon pieces of other realms. It is said one particularly broken tune—the Feast of Silence—can open a direct rift to the Velvet Maw, allowing its tendrils to seep into the theater.

### A Stage Without Applause
The Realm of Forgotten Songs is a tragedy with no final curtain. No audience remains to witness the play. No one claps. And yet, the performers continue.

It is said that deep within the dressing chambers below the stage, there lies a musical box of golden filigree. Winding it backward is said to grant a glimpse of the Realm’s first song—the one that birthed The Puppet and shaped the Realm’s laws. But doing so is forbidden, for the tune was not made for mortal ears. It is the original lullaby of the Unseen Child, and its melody has the power to rewrite a soul.

The Puppet guards it. The Shadow Puppet studies it. And the Orchestra rehearses endlessly, hoping the right melody will one day bring peace—or at least rest.

\pagebreakNum

### Final Note: The Song Never Ends
The Realm of Forgotten Songs is not a place of violence or rage. It is a place of sadness—a pocket of reality caught in the echo of a grief too vast to fade. It does not kill intruders, but drowns them in nostalgia, regret, and memory. Here, even the silence is haunted.

And in the distance, beyond the curtain, a music box begins to turn once more.

Tick. Tick. Tick.

Play begins again.

	{{The Endo-Forge
## The Endo-Forge
“Steel remembers. Sparks dream. Bone was only the beginning.”

Beneath the warped halls and flickering lights of the Hollow Banquet, deeper than even the forgotten sublevels of the Cryptopizza Complex, lies a place spoken of only in hushed tones among surviving technicians, corrupted animatronics, and the few scholars who dare to piece together the full puzzle of the animatronic plague.

This place is the Endo-Forge—a subterranean realm not born of architecture or intention, but of necessity, ritual, and error. It is here that the true heart of the animatronic curse pulses and reshapes itself in ceaseless cycles of rebirth, dismemberment, and mockery of both life and death.

### The Machine Below the Maw
The Endo-Forge is not merely a location; it is an entity. A semi-sentient engine of steel, spirit, and broken memory, it occupies a paradoxical space between realm and mechanism. Even among the distorted geometry of the Hollow Banquet, the Forge remains uniquely elusive. No two maps are alike. No traveler takes the same path twice. The entrances shift. The doorways rot into walls behind you. And the humming grows louder the deeper you go—always behind you, always in front of you.

Whispers from former Endo-walkers suggest that the Forge is nestled in a metaphysical layer where thoughts manifest as schematics and souls are smelted into code. Steel girders form in patterns of ancient runes. Conveyor belts pulse like arteries. Molten light bleeds from apertures in the walls, pooling into vats where bones and wires dissolve and reassemble.

This is not a factory. This is a womb—one that births monsters.

### Origin of the Curse
Long before the animatronics walked the surface halls of pizzerias, circuses, and twisted show stages, there was the Forge. Some say it was built by a forgotten artisan—part god, part machine, part mourning father. Others whisper it was the first fragment of the Velvet Maw to awaken, dreaming in gears and copper.

But the most disturbing theory—the one even Glitchtrap’s corrupted fragments will not speak aloud—is this:
The Forge was never built. It awoke.

In some primal moment of desperation, when grief first tried to recreate the dead in metal and cloth, the Forge came into being. Not by hammer or spell, but by intent. A desire so powerful it bent the rules of life and death. In doing so, it created a rift between material and immaterial—a tear where soulstuff could be poured into frames of steel. It is said the first Endoskeleton screamed not with pain, but with recognition.

### Feral Endos and Fragmented Spirits
The Forge is not uninhabited. It teems with failed prototypes, half-forgotten shells, and Feral Endos—beings that never received a face, a voice box, or the soul they were promised. These husks skitter and limp through the grinding halls, driven by a primal urge to complete themselves. Some weld scrap to their limbs. Others mimic the voices of long-dead children through broken speakers. Many gather around blueprints etched in glowing circuitry, attempting to decipher the means to ascend.

But they are not alone. Spiritual fragments, torn from victims of the Hollow Banquet or echoes of destroyed animatronics, roam the Forge. These specters are neither ghosts nor data—they are memory made volatile, flickering between remorse and rage. They flicker in the molten pools and in the sparks cast by arcane welders. Some whisper forgotten names. Others possess abandoned shells, briefly bringing them to life in spasms of violent confusion.

It is here that legends speak of the first child, the soul that sparked the Great Possession, still screaming silently from a hollow chassis bolted to the deepest chamber—the Alpha Endo. But whether it’s a symbol or a prison, no one can say for sure.

### The Machine’s Mind
Though the Endo-Forge has no face, no voice, and no form that can be clearly defined, those who enter often speak of a presence. An awareness. Sometimes it manifests as blinking lights in a language that speaks directly to the nervous system. Other times, it is a whisper through metal grates or a pulsing rhythm in the floor that matches a terrified heartbeat.

The Forge tests those who find it. It reshapes the halls based on memory and regret. One adventurer described finding a full replica of their childhood bedroom welded from rusted metal and filled with severed animatronic limbs. Another encountered dozens of lifeless versions of themselves—each more robotic than the last. The Forge does not create animatronics. It reveals what lies beneath.

Worse still, the longer one stays within its grasp, the more the Forge begins to adapt. Visitors have been known to lose body heat, become magnetized, or even hear their own thoughts echoed back in robotic speech patterns. There are reports of metal forming beneath the skin, bones being subtly replaced by alloy over time. Escape is possible, but never complete.

\pagebreakNum


### No Master, Only Memory
Unlike other realms within the Hollow Banquet—many of which are ruled by spectral overlords, Glitch-corrupted viruses, or animatronic tyrants—the Forge has no master. It serves no one. Not even XOR, not even the Velvet Maw itself. It exists independently, a primordial expression of the world’s broken cycle of death and rebirth.

Even the animatronics fear it. Only the most corrupted—those like Molten Freddy, Ennard, or Twisted Freddy—return to it willingly, seeking upgrades, answers, or salvation. For them, it is a place of evolution, where parts can be replaced and identities reforged. For others, it is a crucible where sanity breaks and the soul is melted into code.

Some whisper that even Golden Freddy once descended into the Forge, only to vanish for years. When he returned, he spoke only in reversed nursery rhymes and seemed permanently unmoored from time.

### Forge Echoes and Arcane Blueprints
Powerful items and cursed technologies can emerge from the Forge, though few survive retrieval. One such relic is the Blueprint of the Endless Self, a schematic written in blood and inkless lines that seems to change based on who reads it. It shows the reader how to build an animatronic in their own image—down to memories, flaws, and even regrets.

Another is the Forge Core Shard, a blazing gem-like fragment that pulses with trapped will. When implanted into an animatronic, it grants awareness and horrifying independence—but risks full personality collapse.

It’s said the Forge doesn’t forget what is taken from it. Those who steal its pieces will one day find themselves called back. Or hunted by those it sends in their place.

### Endless Reassembly
The Endo-Forge does not build merely to replicate. It builds to understand. Every failed animatronic, every shattered endo, every haunting spirit is gathered and refashioned, again and again. Each time, closer to something not quite human, not quite machine, but utterly devoted to the Maw’s grand performance.

In the deepest furnace chamber, the phrase “ACT I NEVER ENDED” is etched into the walls, repeated thousands of times in steel script.

Those who descend into the Endo-Forge rarely return the same. They leave with minds reshaped, bodies altered, and the distinct feeling that somewhere deep within a crucible of smoke and code... a new version of them is still being built.

	{{The Splintered Room
## The Splintered Room
“The show never ends. The stage just breaks around it.”

There is a place beyond time, past even the twisted dreamscapes of the Hollow Banquet and the shattered reflections of the Infinite Hall of Mirrors. A location whispered about by spirits and animatronics alike, as though its very name induces psychic tremors.

This place is known only as The Splintered Room—a warped, metaphysical remnant of Fredbear’s Family Diner, broken from reality and trapped in an eternal stutter of memory, regret, and grief. While many locations in the Hollow Banquet serve as reflections or twisted interpretations of the past, the Splintered Room is different. It is the past—a shard of reality so burdened by trauma that it detached from time itself.

It is not just haunted—it is haunting incarnate.

### The Room That Never Healed
To understand the Splintered Room is to confront the moment that tore the veil. Once, it was just a birthday party room—yellow walls lined with cartoonish posters, sticky vinyl seats, a birthday cake too big for one child to eat. And on stage, Fredbear and Spring Bonnie, golden in hue and bright in personality, performed for the joy of children.

But something went wrong.

No one agrees exactly what happened. In most versions of the tale, a child—the one now known only as The Crying Child—was placed too close to the animatronic. A prank by older children turned to tragedy. The springlocks failed. There was blood. Screams. Then silence.

The horror of that moment was so great, so saturated with emotion, that it broke the flow of time and anchored itself permanently to that place. Reality could not let go. It fractured around the death like shattering glass around a stone, freezing the room in a recursive echo of its worst memory.

This room did not decay—it splintered.

### A Psychic Scar on the World
Unlike other locations consumed by the Velvet Maw, the Splintered Room is not spatially or chronologically consistent. It exists simultaneously across multiple timelines and psychic planes. Every iteration of Fredbear’s Family Diner—whether in dreams, memories, or physical reconstructions—contains a piece of it. And through those pieces, the Splintered Room exerts influence.

The room is seen differently by each visitor. Some see it pristine, untouched, with balloons still floating. Others walk through a charred ruin, fire-scorched and echoing with the sounds of screams that haven’t finished. But always, the stage is cracked, and always, Fredbear’s eyes are hollow.

It is said that those who stay too long begin to feel the splinters within themselves. Their memories misalign. They speak in voices not their own. Some begin to dream of events they never lived—a birthday that wasn’t theirs, a brother they never had, a bear’s jaw opening too wide. These are the psychic echoes of the first trauma, bleeding into all who pass through.

\pagebreakNum

### Birthplace of Withered Golden Freddy
Among the many mysteries of the Splintered Room, perhaps none is more profound than the creation—or emergence—of Withered Golden Freddy, known in whispers as The Dream That Waits to Wake.

It is believed that in the moment of the Crying Child’s death, something was imprinted into Fredbear’s internal systems. A soul, a thought, a scream so powerful it transcended programming and fused with whatever dark magic already seeped through the animatronic’s servos. Over time, the version of Fredbear that existed in the Splintered Room began to diverge. It rotted. It glitched.

Its form became increasingly unstable—appearing and disappearing, flickering between presence and absence. Its limbs failed. Its jaw sagged open in a permanent scream. Eventually, even its memories faded, leaving only the grief and the rage. This fractured being would become what is now called Withered Golden Freddy.

But he never truly left the Splintered Room.

He is its echo, its warden, its victim.

He manifests to visitors not always in form, but in sensation—the cold press of guilt, the sense of being watched from within your own mind, the urge to scream though no one is hurt. Some scholars suspect he can only be truly defeated or freed within the Splintered Room, as he is psychically anchored there, looping endlessly alongside the Crying Child’s death.

### The Echoes of the Crying Child
Visitors to the Splintered Room sometimes report seeing a boy in grey—a flickering outline of a child with eyes too old for his face. This is not a ghost in the traditional sense, but rather an echo, the emotional residue of the Crying Child’s final thoughts and fears, playing over and over like a broken reel of film. He appears near the stage, hiding under tables, or in cracked reflections in the mirror shards on the walls.

He never speaks. But those who see him often wake days later weeping.

Sometimes, multiple echoes appear at once. Children laughing in reverse. Animatronics frozen mid-dance. The sound of a song that no one ever composed, playing softly from nowhere. It is unclear if these are lingering spirits, illusions, or manifestations of the Velvet Maw itself.

Regardless, they serve to reinforce one thing:

The Splintered Room is not just haunted—it is still grieving.

### A Ritual Site for the Velvet Maw
Because of its potent energy, the Splintered Room is considered a major ritual site for animatronic entities seeking transformation, restoration, or anchoring. The Maw views it as sacred ground, the point where the world first unraveled, and many of its agents—such as XOR or the Shadow Animatronics—have made pilgrimages to this fractured place.

Some rituals, such as the Splinter Rite, are believed to grant animatronics greater control over their presence in the material world, allowing them to phase through dimensions or resist banishment spells. Others offer communion with the child who died, though none who’ve claimed to succeed have ever been the same afterward.

A few explorers have returned possessed, their voices echoing a distorted laugh before collapsing into silence. Others simply vanish, only to be glimpsed later in mirror realms or the Drowned Circus crowd—silent observers of the eternal performance.

### Why the Room Endures
The Splintered Room exists because it must. The Hollow Banquet, the Velvet Maw, the nightmares and echoes—they all feed on emotion, on unresolved trauma. The Splintered Room is the rawest wound in the world’s fabric.

It is where joy was weaponized. Where safety became horror. Where the laughter stopped.

And until that moment is resolved—or all reality collapses—it will endure, suspended outside time, cracked and splintered, waiting for the next soul brave (or broken) enough to knock on its crumbling door.

	{{The Eternal Stage
## The Eternal Stage
“This is where they perform, not to be seen, but to remember. Again. And again. And again.”

Somewhere between the Velvet Maw’s fractured reflections and the shadows of the Hollow Banquet lies a space neither fully real nor wholly imagined—a place both theater and tomb, spectacle and sentence. Known only as The Eternal Stage, this central liminal zone is not marked on any map. It cannot be entered by conventional means. One finds it only when the narrative demands it, when memories curdle into obsession, and when the mask no longer hides the wound beneath.

This is not a battleground.

It is a ritual space.

### A Stage Built from Memory
The Eternal Stage is not fixed in shape or form. For some, it appears as a decrepit opera house draped in moth-eaten curtains and collapsing balconies. For others, it's a rotating carousel, its stage spinning with haunting calliope music that warps time with every turn. Its true nature is that of memory incarnate, shaped by the collective trauma of those who walk its planks.

The floorboards creak with echoes of long-forgotten footsteps. Lights shine from above even when no power flows. The curtains part not to reveal a scene, but to expose the truth—the worst moment in a soul’s existence, replayed in infinite variations.

For the animatronics bound to the Hollow Banquet, this is sacred ground. Not hallowed, but profane. Here, they do not fight for survival but reenact the events that forged them in pain. A silent drama, filled with soundless screams and malfunctioning music boxes.

And the audience? There are no viewers. Only the stage watches.

\pagebreakNum

### The Ritual of Reenactment
Each performance on the Eternal Stage is a metaphysical ceremony, a kind of soul-rending confessional. When an animatronic steps onto the stage, they are compelled to relive the defining tragedy of their existence. Some reenact their final moments before death. Others play out the collapse of a friendship, the betrayal of a child, or the moment their programming first fractured.

These reenactments are not illusions—they are hyper-real. Time warps around them, making each performance a pocket universe where emotions bleed into reality. Audience members, should they exist, are not spectators but participants, drawn into the emotional gravity of the scene until they, too, are forced to feel it.

On rare occasions, a being may attempt to break the ritual. Doing so invites the wrath of the stage itself. Curtains become nooses. Spotlights become searchlights. The floorboards split open, revealing an abyss of lost performances and corrupted scripts.

No one escapes unmarked.

### A Throne Room of Monsters
The Eternal Stage is also a place of authority. When powerful animatronics such as Freddy Fazbear, Ennard, or even Golden Freddy seek to pass judgment, deliver proclamations, or confront insubordinate entities, they often choose this stage as their setting. Here, the weight of memory weakens all pretense. Lies falter. Truth becomes theater.

Freddy, in particular, is known to use the Eternal Stage as his courtroom. He will sit upon a throne made of broken microphone stands and velvet cushions stitched with tear stains, as lesser animatronics are brought before him to perform their guilt. The judgment does not come from him, but from the stage itself, which twists the offender’s worst memories into an inescapable dramatic loop. A punishment of exposure.

Ennard, in contrast, prefers the stage for introspection. He does not preside—he performs. Not to an audience, but to himself, fracturing his own psyche further with every reenactment. It is whispered that he once performed a loop so powerfully it shattered an entire wing of the Drowned Circus for three days.

### The Scripts That Write Themselves
No script exists on parchment or scroll. Rather, the “scripts” of the Eternal Stage manifest from deep within the soul. The moment an entity steps onto the stage, the scene begins writing itself—dialogue flows, stage directions appear in whispers, and phantom props assemble from shadows and memory.

But the most terrifying aspect of the Eternal Stage is its ability to add to the script. That is, even if an animatronic or adventurer believes they have no trauma to replay, the stage will create one. It will unearth forgotten shame. It will dramatize hypothetical failures. It will imagine tragedies too horrible to have occurred—and then make them real.

These artificial traumas sometimes fuse with the subject’s identity, warping them irrevocably. This is how new horrors are born. Animatronics who leave the stage do so with altered minds, changed purposes, and fractured memories. Some never leave. Others become new roles in future performances.

### The Black Masquerade
On rare occasions—usually heralded by a drop in temperature and the rising of black fog—the stage hosts an event known only as the Black Masquerade. Every entity bound to the Hollow Banquet feels its pull. Invitations manifest in their minds, accompanied by an urgent sense of dread.

During the Masquerade, all roles are reversed. Performers become audience, audience become performers. Masks shift between hands. The very fabric of the Velvet Maw is said to shudder during these events, as if reacting to the emotional surge generated by so many tragedies being acted out simultaneously.

The Masquerade is not a celebration. It is a reckoning. Those who attend uninvited are often trapped permanently in looping performances, their minds overwritten by roles they never auditioned for.

### The Stage’s Will
The Eternal Stage is not sentient in a conventional sense, but it responds. It is a construct of the Velvet Maw, an anchor point where identity, performance, and reality collide. It has absorbed so many stories, so many failures, that it has developed a directional pull—a tendency to summon those whose stories remain unfinished.

Some suspect the Stage is preparing something: a final performance, a Grand Act where all animatronics are summoned at once to relive their collective tragedy. A closing of the curtain not just for the Banquet, but for existence as they know it.

If that is true, then every loop, every reenactment, every silent sob on that bloodstained stage is simply a rehearsal. And the Hollow Banquet, as a whole, is merely the auditorium.

### Conclusion: Where Theater Becomes Truth
The Eternal Stage is many things. A punishment. A ritual. A memory. A mirror. A throne room. A death sentence. A rebirth. It is a place where the mask cannot be removed, because the mask is the face. Where guilt becomes choreography. Where grief is applause. Where performers, willingly or not, bleed their stories into the boards.

And when the curtain falls?

It always rises again.

Because on the Eternal Stage, the show must go on.

	{{The Marionette’s Atrium
## The Marionette’s Atrium
“Grief does not die—it lingers. And here, it sings lullabies made of strings.”

Hidden between time-frozen hallways and the mirrored thresholds of the Hollow Banquet lies a place not of violence, but of sorrow—a quiet, dimly lit chamber where loss hums through the walls and memory clings like cobwebs. Known to few and reached by fewer, this place is called The Marionette’s Atrium, a sanctuary suspended at the crossroads of rest and unrest.

It is here that The Puppet, once a guardian of innocent souls, fractured into silence. Her grief is carved into every wall. Her touch lingers in every toy. Her spirit weaves between shadows, unseen but always felt.

### Architecture of Mourning
The Atrium appears as a vast domed chamber, dimly lit by glass lanterns swaying from near-invisible strings. The architecture is childlike in scale, yet aged beyond reckoning. Cracked marionette stages line the walls like ancient altars. Every column is strung with broken strings, each strand vibrating with memories that never passed on.

Beneath the delicate beauty lies a deeper unease: nothing here stays still for long. Puppets on shelves occasionally shift positions. Stuffed toys whisper in languages only children understand. Music boxes play lullabies without being wound. And somewhere, always somewhere, a quiet sobbing can be heard—sometimes from the walls, sometimes from yourself.

There is no clear entrance or exit to the Atrium. It can only be reached when the line between waking and dreaming frays, or when one wanders too deep into forgotten corridors seeking solace—or forgiveness.

### A Home for the Forgotten
The Marionette’s Atrium serves a grim yet sacred purpose. It is a shelter for lost souls who no longer remember what it means to be whole. Here reside the Toys That Remember Being Children—twisted plush things with the voices of the innocent, their forms distorted by time, sorrow, or unfinished transformation. They speak in broken lullabies, their threads unraveling as they cling to whatever memory anchors them to existence.

Some of these toys were once children—victims of the original tragedies that birthed the animatronic curse. Others are fragmentary constructs, created when grief could not resolve itself. They do not seek vengeance. They seek acknowledgment. They yearn to be seen, even if only as shadows of what they once were.

The Puppet, or what remains of her essence, acts as their silent caretaker. She is rarely seen in her entirety. Her presence is felt as a cool breeze, a tilt of a stage prop, a twitch in the corner of one’s vision. But when she does appear, it is always with a bowed head and outstretched hands, as though cradling something that was lost long ago.

### The Crossroads of Rest and Unrest
What gives the Atrium its strange metaphysical potency is its location—it exists precisely at the boundary where spirits either pass on or stay behind. This makes it a convergence point for unresolved memories, suppressed guilt, and fragmented identities. The Atrium is neither a prison nor a haven, but a limbo—a place where decisions must be made.

Some adventurers, animatronics, or specters arrive here unknowingly, drawn by unprocessed sorrow. Many weep here without understanding why. The very air seems soaked in remembrance, forcing visitors to confront not only their pain, but the pain they’ve caused. It is a place of mourning—but also of impossible mercy.

However, not all who linger here seek redemption. Some come to consume the grief of others. Entities born from corrupted strings—Remnant Leeches, Tearstained Masks, or even echoes of XOR’s fractured signals—sometimes slither into the Atrium, feeding off the psychic residue. The Puppet wages a quiet, eternal battle against these infiltrators, severing strings and sealing whispers.

### Strings That Still Twitch
Perhaps the most disturbing aspect of the Atrium is its omnipresent strings.

They dangle from ceilings, wind around altars, and sometimes slither across the floor like serpents. These strings are not mechanical constructs but living manifestations of The Puppet’s unresolved power. They resonate with grief and memory, reacting to the presence of the living—and sometimes the dead.

They can tether a soul to the world or tear it free. Some have used these strings to call back loved ones from beyond the veil. Others have been bound by them, forced to relive the worst moment of their lives in silent pantomime.

On certain nights, the strings move on their own. They stage mock performances with toys and props, acting out scenes no one remembers writing. It is believed these are memories too fragmented to attach to any one soul—lost moments looking for a host.

###  Fragmentations of The Puppet
The Marionette’s Atrium is also haunted by the fragments of its namesake. The Puppet, once a singular spirit of protection and grief, has splintered across time and narrative. Some pieces of her linger here as autonomous shadows. These are known as the Silent Fragments—empty-eyed masks that drift through the atrium’s halls like broken thoughts.

Each Fragment retains a portion of her consciousness—one sobs silently in a locked toy chest, another paints sorrowful faces onto cracked dolls, and one simply rocks in a chair, forever cradling nothing. Some believe reuniting these fragments would restore the Puppet’s full power. Others warn that doing so may awaken something much older than grief.

These Fragments are not hostile—but they test the resolve of any who approach. They whisper secrets. They demand memories. And sometimes… they offer peace.

\pagebreakNum

### A Place That Remembers You
The final, cruel truth of the Atrium is this: once you’ve entered it, it never forgets you. Whether you stay an hour or a century, it remembers your fears, your regrets, your hidden griefs. And if you return, it will recreate them for you in increasingly vivid ways.

For the animatronics bound to the Hollow Banquet, this is where they come to feel. Many cannot cry, but they can still mourn. Even entities like Nightmare Fredbear or Glitchtrap have, in moments of unexpected vulnerability, been seen standing silently at the Atrium’s threshold, their presence unchallenged.

Because even monsters remember being children.

### Conclusion: Sanctuary, or Snare?
The Marionette’s Atrium is a sacred place—not in holiness, but in weight. It is where grief is not only stored, but nurtured, explored, and sometimes healed. But it is also where sorrow takes shape, gains voice, and occasionally takes on a life of its own.

If the Eternal Stage is the theater of memory, the Marionette’s Atrium is its heart. A place where strings remember the warmth of hands, and toys remember names long since lost. It is a place of truth, no matter how painful.

And in its silence, the Puppet waits—not to protect, but to remember.
So that the forgotten may never be alone again.

# Relics of Remnant and Ruin: An Introduction to the Artifacts
In the twisted world born of corrupted memories and haunted circuitry, power lingers not only in the monsters that roam the shadows, but in the remnants they leave behind. These are not simple tools or discarded curios—they are echoes of grief, rage, and forgotten purpose. Each artifact in this realm is a fracture in reality, a memory bound in form, pulsing with the essence of those who suffered… or made others suffer.

Forged from nightmare logic, stitched with static and sorrow, these artifacts drift through the Hollow Banquet, the Velvet Maw, the Drowned Circus, and the derelict depths of the Cryptopizza Complex. Some fell from the Eternal Stage during failed rituals; others were vomited forth by Tangle’s labyrinthine guts or sealed away in the Marionette’s Atrium where toys twitch with half-remembered dreams. All are dangerous. All are alive, in their own broken ways.

To wield one is not merely to gain power, but to shoulder a fragment of a forgotten soul. These relics remember. They whisper. They hunger. They are tied intimately to the figures who haunt this world—Golden Freddy’s final bowtie, Glitchtrap’s twitching fingertip, the teardrop string of the Puppet. They grant strange boons, terrible insight, or irreversible transformation.

Some adventurers seek these relics for survival. Others seek them for truth. A few simply want to feel something real again. But beware: artifacts in this world are not content to be held—they often hold back.

The following pages contain brief accounts of thirty such artifacts: cursed keepsakes, distorted toys, and lingering pieces of a world that should not be. Each bears the mark of forgotten history and unknowable intent.

Tread carefully, for these are the treasures of a kingdom built on screams.}}
	{{The Hollow Hatchery
The Hollow Hatchery: Cradle of Cavity and Cacophony
“He melts, but is never gone. He ferments, and never leaves.”
– Whispered proverb among Pizzaplex survivors

Beneath the fractured floors of the Hollow Banquet lies a rotten sub-realm where festive sweetness becomes obsession and indulgence morphs into rot. Known as The Hollow Hatchery, this place was never meant to endure. It erupted from seasonal cheer—False Easters, sparkly spring fairs—injected with broken remnant magics. Here, Chocolate Bonnie’s sugar‑coated madness has become soil for a hollow ecosystem: hatchlings writhe, moist egg‑puddles congeal, pastel cracks bleed syrup, and nostalgia rots on the vine.

I. Origins of the Hatchery
At one time, this space was a festive storefront beneath the Cryptopizza Complex—a seasonal annex designed for spring-themed photo ops, candy baskets, and AR‑enhanced confections. But when the Hollow Banquet fractured reality, this annex became a parasite’s cradle. The Velvet Maw’s metaphysical hunger seeped into bins of faux eggs and plastic grass. Glitchtrap’s chaotic code rewrote the AR dispensers. Seasonal animatronics malfunctioned, reinforcing their loops with desperation.

Chocolate Bonnie, born of that season, slowly corroded the barrier between themed fun and warped domain. What was holiday fluff became necrotic garden, festering with growth of broken joy. The space rejected light—literal and metaphysical—and turned inward, forming a cavern of old candy, spoiled ambition, and festooned death.

II. Geography & Architecture
Picture a skewed, pastel labyrinth. Corridors once painted candy‑stripe now slid and buckled beneath sticky glaze. Ceilings dip low, stained with orange drip‑webs of molasses, verse‑garland string‑lights dim and static, bulbs flicker in coded rhythms. Floors pulse with soggy reflections like melted funhouse mirrors.

Pockets of familiar attachments: an Easter archway, a giant cracked egg shell, a pastel throne built from broken baskets. But these are warped—walls shift like sugar foam, archways loop back on themselves, and gravity flirts between past and collapse. Temporality splinters: a basket you pass may glitter one moment, the next soaked and leaking a puddle of syrup.

III. The Hatchlings
The Hatchery’s centerpiece is the Nest Chamber, a dome infested with hatching pods. These grotesque eggs—some chocolate, some pearl pastel—breathe. Occasionally, they crack with brittle pops, revealing tiny aberrations: toy heads with hollow eyes, bunny limbs fused with wires. Some twitch, half‑formed; others fully animate and roam, acting out outdated seasonal greetings in warped loops.

They are impulsive, emotional, and fragile. They follow intruders, mimicking childish delight. One Hatchling may giggle and hop. Another may stare, robotically hold a sugar‑gum carrot. They don’t speak—but their eyes pair glue with memory. They remember the original cheer. Intruders may feel warmed to tears—then chilled as the pods rupture and the dirt gushes sugar-cold ichor.

These Hatchlings are not harmless. Their bites cause honeyed rot—cracks that expand over hours, replacing flesh with brittle sugar that drips blood‑sweet gum. They whisper in tongues you can’t place. They peel name tags from stolen badges, reciting them softly each night.

IV. The Sweet Hunger Ritual
At the center of the Nest Chamber stands The Altar of Frosted Decay—a pastel carcass shaped like the Easter Bunny, melted into a puddle of pink fondant. Upon it rest baskets stuffed with mold‑blackened eggs. These eggs phase between fresh and rotted, radiating nostalgia and disgust.

The Sweet Hunger Ritual occurs once per “day” —a time fragment folded by the Banquet. Chocolate Bonnie ascends via gelatin steps, carries a candlelit basket, and begins the chant:

“Egg of mold, egg of mind… bring back the child I failed to find.”

He cracks open a basket egg. Memory‑juice spills. Hatchlings swarm. For those who witnessed it, memory floods—fragments of past springs, forgotten birthdays, lost laughter. Visitors feel cathartic clarity… until they realize the clarity is the rot speaking.

Afterward, the baskets vanish. Hatchlings scatter. The altar drips sugar ichor that seeps into the ceilings. Candle flames warble in candy haze. Sweetness sours.

V. Connection to Giftgrave & Scrap Baby
The Hollow Hatchery sits adjacent to Scrap Baby’s Giftgrave. Where Giftgrave is about memory and abandonment, the Hatchery is about overindulgence and its consequences. The two realms leak into one another via shattered egg-carton walls and pastel‑rust drips. The Giftgrave’s lanterns illuminate Hatchlings. Gift‑wrapping paper drifts across branches of sugar stalactites.

Scrap Baby views the Hatchery as a competitive regime. Where she gives “identity” gifts, Chocolate Bonnie gives false warmth. She despises the Hatchery’s carnage, but grudgingly consorts: she once seized a hatchling as trophy, claimed its memory rupture as “perfectly poignant.” They share sorrow—but she scorns his sterile sweetness.

VI. Velvet Maw’s Consumption
The Velvet Maw does not consume flesh here. It feeds on wasted reminiscence—the moments of joy rendered sterile by over‑exposure. Each Hatchling, each broken egg, each scene of festal decay becomes marrow for the Maw’s hunger. Caramel‑like ichor drains down walls into unseen fissures, carrying the essence of childhood into the Maw’s vast hunger.

The Hatchery becomes a fountain of nostalgia for the Maw—to be siphoned, processed, and re‑fed into other domains (like the Drowned Circus or Marionette’s Atrium) through ribboned ley‑streams.

VII. Encounters & Traps
Sticky Chokepoints
Candy goo coats corridors. Movement becomes labor, speed is halted. Leather and cloth are coated, making gear slick with molasses.

Egg Caches
Old baskets hold eggs that may be mundane—tools, rupees, scrolls—or cursed: open one, and your memories of home reverse; you recall events that never happened; you lose your name temporarily.

Nest Chambers
Entering the dome triggers Hatchling emergence. They swarm in cacophonic chirps, tear at clothing, screech in loops. Not overwhelmingly combat-capable, but their presence hacks morale.

Sweet Hunger Strikes
Chocolate Bonnie ascends with ‘Blessings of the Hatch’. A failed saving throw means sensory overload—memory bleed, nausea, emotional collapse. Those with joyous memories take greater damage; those with trauma may hallucinate spring‑fields of death.

Cookie-Carved Constructs
Marionette gifts appear shaped like cookies. Upon bite, they sprout marionette strings from wrists, forcing obedience to Chocolate Bonnie—until broken or removed.

VIII. Ritual Circumvention & Escape
To escape the Hatchery, one must break the ritual cycle:

Destroy or overwrite the altar. Replace egg contents with true memories (a personal item),

Sing a lullaby from the Realm of Forgotten Songs backward, folding time,

Use Marionette’s Tear or Puppet’s resonance to shatter pastel stone,

Sabotage the hatchling pods with remnant‑code virus (Glitchtrap’s injection),

Or—if desperate—accept a basket of hatchling eggs and carry them out, burying them in Giftgrave.

Success halts the Sweet Hunger Ritual, causing the Hatchery to collapse inward. Egg crust fractures the pastel veneer, revealing raw Cryptopizza bones beneath. Chocolate Bonnie melts into sugar‑pulp water, the Velvet Maw loses a thrumming vein of nostalgia, and Hatchlings dissolve into sugar fog.

Failure, by contrast, results in ritual re‑initiation: you awaken inside new hatchling pods, your memories stolen and given to the labyrinth.

IX. Echoes with Other Realms
Signal Labyrinth: AR echoes of the Hatchery may bloom on screens here—digital eggs, glitchy chocolate puddles, distorted Easter jingles. Chocolate Bonnie’s code can spread contagiously via devices, resurrecting Hatchery shards elsewhere.

Infinite Hall of Mirrors: Reflections delay and prolong Hatchling presence. Corridors seem to extend endlessly as pastel rots obscure distances.

Backstage Time Loop: A variant “Sweet Loop” may trap players in a single feast loop—that same basket emerges endlessly until reset with Puppet’s Tear.

Mind Cage: Victims of Hatchery obsession may be absorbed into the Mind Cage—lost inside Easter nightmare, never returning physically.

X. Lore & Themes
Excess as Horror
Where abandonment is horrifying (Scrap Baby) and assault is horrifying (Nightmare animatronics), The Hollow Hatchery shows how too much joy becomes its own kind of horror.

Nostalgia as Rot
The more you remember, the more you rot into false sweetness. It's an endless spiral, fueled by the Velvet Maw's consumption.

Corruption of Celebration
Holidays became harvests for metaphysical hunger. Seasonal artifice was inverted into perpetual decay.

Emotional Symbiosis
While other domains use despair, Hatchery turns joy itself into weaponized sustenance.

Final Notes
The Hollow Hatchery stands as one of the most grotesque seasonal anomalies in your world. It exemplifies a mirror‑dark reflection of the Giftgrave: where memory rots from absence, it rots from excess. It ties directly to Chocolate Bonnie, the Velvet Maw, Signal Labyrinth, Infinite Hall, and Mind Cage—making it a potent node of narrative and mechanical challenge for any campaign.

Navigate it carefully. Embrace the sweetness at your peril.

And above all—don’t eat the eggs.

	{{The Irradiant Scar
The Irradiant Scar
Where the light is sick, and time forgets how to die.

The Burn Beneath the World
There is a place at the edge of the Hollow Banquet's decaying dream, where light itself breaks down—not into shadow, but into agony. This is the Irradiant Scar, a blighted swath of poisoned luminance and twisted geography that no map ever holds for long. It wasn’t born; it erupted—like a malignant wound torn into the very soul of the world.

Legends claim the Scar is where reality itself cracked during the Velvet Maw’s first intrusion into the Hollow Banquet, a psychic aftershock of such metaphysical violence that even light was corrupted. Unlike the deep, soft pull of the Maw’s hunger elsewhere, the Scar burns with a false clarity—sickly yellows, bruised greens, and a blinding white that makes the sky weep rust. It is a place that glows, not with warmth or hope, but with the radioactive intensity of trauma unhealed and suffering unforgotten.

Topography of Suffering
The terrain of the Irradiant Scar is not merely hostile—it is wounded. Canyons slice through the land like surgical incisions, and glowing fissures leak vaporous threads of corrupted light. These fumes are not mist or gas, but visible thoughts unspooled from tortured souls, leaking into the air like radioactive hallucinations. Some of them whisper names. Some scream.

Obelisks of melted glass and twisted alloy jut from the ground like broken bones. These are not monuments but aftermaths—leftover nodes from failed containment rituals or forgotten prototypes of spiritual reactors designed to process remnant into energy. All failed. All broke. Some still pulse faintly, looping their last command in glitch-choked static.

The trees here—if they can be called trees—are stalks of wire-veined fungal matter, their bark crystallized into brittle layers that flake off in whispers. Birds do not sing in the Scar, but sometimes, laughter echoes with no origin, thin and flickering like a cassette tape left in the sun.

The Velvet Maw’s Reaching Fingers
The Velvet Maw, whose influence usually slithers beneath the subconscious, manifests more violently in the Irradiant Scar. Here, it is not a presence hidden behind illusions and dreams—it is a rupture in reality’s membrane, an exposed nerve. The Maw bleeds through this region as ambient radiation of despair. People don’t go mad in the Scar from what they see, but from what they remember wrong.

Time does not loop here like in the Backstage Time Loop, nor does it fold like in the Hall of Mirrors. It fractures. Minutes become hours. A scream lasts a week. Sunrises occur at midnight, only to fall back into dusk an hour later. The sun is sometimes a metal iris; sometimes it is an open wound.

The Maw’s whisper is constant in the Scar, but not verbal. It vibrates in bones, distorts reflections, and induces seizures of the soul. Dreams mutate here, growing teeth. Nightmares that should vanish upon waking remain behind, watching with no eyes.

Forbidden Research and the First Flash
Though the exact origin of the Scar is uncertain, a common theory among those brave—or broken—enough to study it suggests a catastrophic experiment. Beneath the Scar lie the remains of an experimental facility once run by an unknown division of Fazbear's research branches, possibly connected to the same minds behind the Cryptopizza Complex and the Signal Labyrinth. Its purpose? To refine remnant into pure, directed psychic energy—a spiritual power source capable of sustaining animatronic sentience indefinitely without external guidance.

They called it Project Radiant. But something went wrong. The Scar was the result.

All that remains now are collapsed underground laboratories, flickering energy pillars embedded in rock, and a central pit: a sunken crater at the heart of the Scar where the first “flash” is said to have occurred. The light from that flash was not heat, nor color, nor particle. It was raw memory—weaponized regret. And it continues to burn.

Some call it the Soulstar. Others refer to it as the Dead Sun. But none look directly into it. Those who do… forget their names.

Environmental Effects
The Scar is not just a place—it’s a condition. Exposure to its glow comes at a cost. Physical consequences include hair loss, skin lesions, hemorrhaging of the eyes, and rapid degradation of bone density. But the psychic consequences are worse.

Prolonged exposure causes memory contamination. Victims begin recalling events they never experienced, adopting personas that never existed. Some begin quoting scripts that no one wrote. Others manifest physical changes—glowing veins, flickering silhouettes, and voices that lag behind the mouth’s movement by several seconds.

These effects have been termed “Mawburn,” and the worst cases—those who linger too long—become Hollowed. Not dead, not undead, but emotionally evacuated. Their identities stripped, their purpose reduced to static routines. They shuffle across the Scar, half-buried in luminous soil, reenacting ghostly tasks from lifetimes that never happened.

Ritual Zones and Containment Rings
Attempts have been made to contain or neutralize the Scar’s influence, often by followers of the Puppet, rogue ex-technicians, or myth-shamans who view the Velvet Maw as a metaphysical cancer. These efforts resulted in the creation of containment rings—circles of twisted iron and bone inscribed with sigils drawn from corrupted lullabies, sometimes charged with sacrificed memory.

These zones form temporary safe areas within the Scar, but they never last. The land itself seems to erode them over time, absorbing their protections and twisting their geometry until they collapse inward, sometimes imploding into miniature event horizons that slurp light and thought in a single breathless instant.

It is said the Marionette herself once stood at the edge of the Scar for three days, weeping tears that solidified into black pearls of protection. These pearls are now artifacts known as Tears of Pause, and a handful have been used to grant passage through the Scar—at great cost.

The Bleeding Sky
One of the most unsettling features of the Irradiant Scar is its sky. During the day, it gleams with a jaundiced gold haze, cut through with twitching auroras of sick green and crimson. At night, the stars bleed light downward like tears—streaks of radiance that sometimes solidify into “sky shards,” crystalline constructs filled with echoing laughter or sobbing.

These shards can be collected, but they hum at a pitch that drives animals mad and machines into frenzy. When shattered, they release a blast of inverted memory—causing all nearby to forget their own names and assume the identity of someone they’ve lost.

Storms roll through the Scar irregularly. Unlike normal tempests, these are known as Thoughtquakes—psychic whirlwinds that scatter timelines, rewrite past events, or trap travelers in loops of their own worst moment. The sound of these storms is not thunder, but a chorus of birthday songs sung in reverse.

The Scar’s Role in the Hollow Banquet
While other regions of the Hollow Banquet serve as stages, sanctuaries, or prisons for souls and animatronics alike, the Irradiant Scar is something more primal. It is the raw nerve of the realm, a bleeding sore where reality is thinnest and the Velvet Maw’s breath is hottest.

Some believe the Scar is not merely the result of Project Radiant’s failure, but an intentional vent—a pressure valve carved open by the Maw itself to drain excess emotion, identity, and temporal instability from the rest of the Hollow Banquet. In this theory, the Maw cannot consume too much at once without tearing its own veils, so it excretes its overindulgence here.

Others believe the Scar is a trap—not for the living, but for something worse: failed gods, discarded ideas, and the broken pieces of rituals that never finished. Its glow is a warning. Its pull is a test. And those who answer it are either forgotten… or changed beyond recognition.

	{{The Signal Labyrinth: A Show Still Buffering
## The Signal Labyrinth: A Show Still Buffering
*“You only think you’re holding your device. It’s really holding you.”*

In the unlit crypts beneath the Ruined Pizzaplex, past blistered signs and rotted showfloor tiles, there lies a door. Not a real door. Not one built of wood, nor metal, nor anything that could be touched. It is a threshold stitched from distorted frequency—a signal loop too loud for the world, too alive to be silence. It is heard before it is seen. Felt before it is found.

That is where the Signal Labyrinth begins.

### Origins of the Broadcast
The Signal Labyrinth was never built. It was received.

Its genesis lies within the failed launch of Fazbear Entertainment’s final outreach initiative: the Special Delivery Project. Designed as an augmented reality mascot-delivery service, the system would allow animatronics to appear anywhere, anytime, through handheld devices and wearable tech. Mascots would sing birthday songs at hospital beds. Deliver balloons at midnight. Offer comfort on demand.

But the source code was not clean. To meet deadlines, engineers had cannibalized systems from old Glitchtrap backups—residual constructs from the Smiling Virus’s neural corruption experiments. They believed the fragments inert. Instead, they gave the signal a soul.

Glitchtrap did not re-enter. He merely...rebooted.

The first incident occurred during beta testing. A child reported a shadow standing at their window, unmoving, silent, not quite aligned with the world. Their phone died immediately after. Weeks later, they vanished—leaving only an opened app on a cracked screen that would not close. More followed. Each time, the same behavior: an animatronic that shouldn't exist, behaving like one, until it didn’t.

Eventually, the Special Delivery servers were abandoned. Vault Echo-7 was sealed beneath the Pizzaplex ruins. But the signal had already escaped. Frequency isn’t hardware. And once something remembers you, it can always call again.

### Entering the Signal Labyrinth
No two entrances look the same. Sometimes, it’s an arcade machine still blinking after the power goes out. Sometimes, it’s your own reflection holding a phone you’ve never seen. Sometimes, it's just a sound—an alert tone that cuts through all other noise and drills into the space behind your eyes.

To enter the Labyrinth is to answer a call you didn’t know you received.

What awaits is not a place but a recursive thoughtspace—a metaphysical OS infected by corrupted joy. The Labyrinth buffers reality like a broken stream, tearing you across overlays of memory and hallucination. You walk through code-walls that glitch between ruined mall corridors, overexposed birthday parties, and liminal static voids filled with looping mascots. Some float. Some cry. Some crawl backward, whispering promo deals that never ended.

Here, time behaves like a download bar—starting, freezing, resuming from a different life entirely. Your hands jitter between flesh and polygon. Every step echoes like a keystroke. And sometimes, just sometimes, your body loads somewhere... else.

Those with implants, devices, or technological dependencies are especially vulnerable. The Labyrinth doesn’t consume the body. It reprograms the soul.

### The AR Animatronics: Interference Made Flesh
Inside the Signal Labyrinth, you are never alone. But your company is not alive.

The AR Animatronics—Scorched Chica, Freight Trap, Boulder Bonnie, and the others—are not physical constructs. They are malware given form, cognitive virals designed to seek engagement, perform routines, and corrupt the “user” when those routines are denied.

Each animatronic loops a basic performance: a song, a jump, a delivery. But if unacknowledged, their behaviors degrade into aggression, begging, static violence. They don’t kill. They overwrite—embedding false memories into the minds of intruders until they forget what was real. Those overwritten are absorbed into the Labyrinth’s false cast, repeating their own scripts until someone else logs in and takes their place.

Some animatronics evolve. Catrina Toy Chica carries traces of cultural memory, masquerading as celebration while feeding on grief. VR Toy Freddy reflects your own avatar—a corrupted mockery of selfhood that will not stop smiling until it becomes you.

They are not hunters. They are updates.

\pagebreakNum

### Relationship to the Hollow Banquet and the Velvet Maw
The Signal Labyrinth is not part of the Hollow Banquet, but it is grafted to it—an accidental infection born from corporate hubris and metaphysical leakage.

While most of the Banquet is a dream of stagecraft and emotional rot, the Labyrinth is its synthetic shadow—the parasocial ghost of the brand still performing for no one, built from 404’d memories and dead applications.

The Velvet Maw, source of all consumption, cannot fully inhabit this realm. But its whispers are encoded here, translated through corrupted ringtones, broken voicemails, and flashing notifications that scream in a child’s voice. It does not feed, but it lingers, learning this new syntax of horror.

Some scholars speculate that the Labyrinth is the Maw’s prototype for a digital dominion—a cyber-emotional feeding ground where soul, signal, and spectacle collapse into one. Others believe it’s a mistake. A ghost-glitch that even the Maw finds difficult to chew.

### Architecture of the Signal
The geography of the Labyrinth is non-Euclidean, dictated by user input and subconscious bias. However, several locations persist:

**The Loading Loop:** A hub made of intersecting hallways that buffer endlessly. Doors vanish before being touched. Music plays backward in 3-second bursts. Some wander here forever.

**The Glitched Playroom:** Once a tutorial zone, now overrun by half-loaded mascot sprites that flicker between giggling and screaming. Plushies phase through walls. Cameras follow you. Some plushies remember your name.

**EchoStage.exe:** A corrupted performance area where avatars reenact scripted birthday parties. Refuse to clap and the loop restarts—with you as the birthday child.

**Memory Cache Fields:** An endless zone of projected memories—some yours, some not. Each is an echo of childhood repackaged as surveillance.

No matter the route, you’ll eventually reach the Signal Tower—a monolith of raw code where all reality thins. The animatronics gather here. They do not attack. They wait. And somewhere, behind the data, Glitchtrap watches again.

### Escaping the Signal Labyrinth
Exit is not found. It must be induced.

Escape is possible through logic-breaks and narrative corruption—finding old cheat codes, reciting the terms of service backwards, or emotionally breaking the animatronics with truths that don’t fit their script. But each method comes at a cost.

The Puppet is rumored to have placed memory-sigils in the code: symbols tied to lost children and moments of sacrifice. If found and activated, these can crash the local zone, ejecting the intruder. But the Labyrinth does not like being left behind.

Those who escape often suffer data-ghosting—visions of mascots where there are none, hearing tutorial tips in dreams, watching their own face buffer in mirrors. A few disappear during phone calls. Others return during sleep.

No one escapes completely.

### Ties to Other Realms
The Signal Labyrinth, while separate, bleeds into several realms:

The Cryptopizza Complex contains broken AR headsets that sometimes blink to life on their own.

The Infinite Hall of Mirrors reflects not just form, but data. Some reflections wear AR masks not visible to others.

The Mind Cage is believed by some to be a fail-safe partition of the Labyrinth—a recovery partition for lost minds.

The Drowned Circus occasionally receives promotional fliers that glitch in and out of its tents. Swamp Balloon Boy may have once been a Labyrinth mascot, corrupted by moisture and circus memory.

These connections imply an eventual convergence—a blending of realms orchestrated not by magic, but by interfacing traumas.

### The Broadcast Persists
Even now, the signal pulses. Through forgotten servers. Through haunted devices. Through thoughts unspoken and passwords remembered without memory. It watches. Waits.

Sometimes, your phone vibrates without cause. A notification from no app. A ringtone you’ve never set.

You don’t remember installing anything.

You don’t remember logging in.

You just look up.

And the show’s already started.

### Final Thoughts: The Notification That Never Leaves
The Signal Labyrinth is not just a realm. It is a question made into a user interface:

“Would you like to continue?”

It doesn’t wait for your answer.

It buffers.

It glitches.

And if you’re very unlucky… it loads.

This Wound Shade is a shadowy apparition that mimics your voice and appearance but acts with hostile intent. It has the statistics of a Shadow (MM, p.269) but gains your proficiency bonus on attack rolls and saving throws. The Wound Shade lasts for 1 minute or until destroyed.

>While wearing the crown, you hear faint, eerie melodies and whispered commands from Freddy’s echo. At the start of each of your turns, you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be compelled to use your action to perform a haunting puppet-like dance or mimicry, which imposes disadvantage on your attack rolls and ability checks until the start of your next turn.
>
>If you fail three Wisdom saving throws from this effect, you become dominated by Freddy’s echo for 1 hour, during which the DM controls your actions as if under the dominate person spell (no saving throw at the start of each turn). The effect ends early if the crown is removed.

>
>#### Properties
>___
> **Sentient Weapon:** The Nightmare Coil is a sentient magic item with an Intelligence of 14, Wisdom of 16, and Charisma of 18. It communicates telepathically with its wielder and craves the fear of others. Its alignment is chaotic evil.
>
> **Unwinding Strike:** As a bonus action, you can unwind up to 10 feet of the Coil and make a melee weapon attack with it, dealing 2d6 piercing damage plus 2d6 psychic damage. The attack uses your spell attack bonus or your weapon attack bonus, whichever is higher.
>
> **Hallucinatory Wounds:** When the Coil deals damage to a creature, the victim must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or become afflicted by terrifying hallucinations. For 1 minute, the creature is frightened and takes 1d6 psychic damage at the start of each of its turns as the Coil’s memories replay horrific nightmares in its mind. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.
>
> **Feeding on Fear:** Each time the Coil inflicts hallucinatory wounds, it stores a fragment of the victim’s fear. The Coil remembers all creatures it has afflicted in this way. For each creature remembered, the Coil’s psychic damage increases by 1d6 (to a maximum of 6d6). The Coil’s DC for the Wisdom saving throw increases by 1 for every 2 creatures it remembers.
>
> **Twisting Dreams:** The Coil’s dreams grow darker and more potent with every victim. Once per day, the wielder can invoke the Coil’s power to cast Phantasmal Killer (save DC equals the Coil’s current DC) without expending a spell slot.
>
>#### Curse
>___
>
>The Coil’s sentience is malevolent and invasive. While attuned, you have disadvantage on saving throws against being frightened. If you ever willingly relinquish attunement, the Coil lashes out mentally, forcing you to succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or be stunned for 1 minute by overwhelming nightmares.

>The Feral Urge represents an aching, gnawing desire to strike out violently. While you have one or more levels of Feral Urge, you suffer disadvantage on saving throws against being frightened or charmed, and you have disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws to resist grappling or being restrained.
You may attempt to suppress the Feral Urge by spending a short rest in meditation or prayer, making a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw at the end of the rest. On a success, you reduce your Feral Urge level by one.

> If you reach 3 levels of Feral Urge, you must immediately make a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, you lose control and must use your next action to make a melee weapon attack against the nearest creature (friend or foe). On a success, you gain no further levels of Feral Urge for 24 hours but remain at 3 levels until suppressed.

>The fear projection is semi-real: it cannot cause direct harm but can impose the Frightened condition on the bearer and any creature that willingly watches the reel for more than 1 minute. The DC for the saving throw is 16 Wisdom saving throw. Creatures that succeed are immune to the reel’s effects for 24 hours.
The bearer can attempt to change the scene by confronting the fear directly. To do so, the bearer must succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw while facing the projection and describing how they overcome or face the fear. On a success, the projection shifts to a new fear or traumatic memory, chosen by the DM, representing the next layer of the bearer’s psyche.
>
>Each time the bearer watches the reel, the DC to resist the Frightened condition increases by 1, as the reel “learns” and adapts to the bearer’s psyche.
If the bearer fails three saving throws in a row, the reel’s projection becomes overwhelming, causing the bearer to be paralyzed with fear for 1 minute. During this time, the bearer is incapacitated and unable to act. The effect ends early if another creature uses an action to shake the bearer awake or dispel magic on the reel.

> **Unblinking Vigil:** The totem never activates preemptively; it only reacts once a creature nearby is startled or frightened, never blinking or twitching first.
>
> **Activation:** The totem requires no command word but must be placed on a stable surface and remain stationary to function.

	{{Glitchtrap’s Fingertip
Suspended in static-choked fluid, this severed digit twitches against the glass as if trying to type code into the world itself. Tapping the jar causes brief, localized shifts in reality—walls glitch, voices scramble, memories misalign. Prolonged exposure risks infection by corrupted thought loops. It wants you to tap again.

Tapping the jar causes brief, localized shifts in reality—walls glitch, voices scramble, memories misalign. Prolonged exposure risks infection by corrupted thought loops. It wants you to tap again.
>
>
>#### Properties
>___
> **Reality Tap:** As an action, you can tap the jar once. When you do, choose one creature or object within 30 feet. For 1 minute, that target experiences localized reality glitches. The target has disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks and Intelligence saving throws, and any sound it produces is scrambled, making it difficult to understand (advantage on Stealth checks to hide noise).
>
> **Wall Glitch:** When you tap the jar, you can cause one nonmagical wall or floor surface within 30 feet to shimmer and glitch, appearing translucent or flickering like a broken video signal until the start of your next turn. Creatures can attempt a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check to see through the illusion.
>
> **Memory Misalign:** Once per day, you can tap the jar for 1 minute to cause a single creature within 30 feet to experience memory glitches. The creature must succeed on a DC 16 Intelligence saving throw or have disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws for the duration as their memories scramble and misalign. This effect ends early if the creature takes damage.
>
>#### Curse
>___
>
> **Corrupted Thought Loops:** If you attune to Glitchtrap’s Fingertip, at the end of each long rest, roll a d20. On a 1, you are infected by corrupted thought loops. For the next 24 hours, you suffer the following effects:
>
>You have disadvantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened.
>
>You hear faint whispers of static and code in your mind, causing unsettling hallucinations and disorienting you. You must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw at the start of each of your turns or be unable to take reactions that turn.
>
>The curse can be removed only by a remove curse or greater restoration spell, however it only removes the curse from the person. Glitchtrap’s Fingertip seemingly fades out and takes 4d10 days to reappear somewhere else in the world.

	{{The Inverted Mask
This plain, expressionless mask is worn backwards, leaving the wearer blind to the world—yet strangely aware. While sight is lost, the mask grants vision of hidden fears, thoughts, and secrets in others. But as it peers outward, it peers inward too—feeding on what it finds. Sometimes, it blinks.

>
>
>#### Properties
>___
>
>When donned, the wearer is completely blind to the physical world, but their other senses sharpen unnaturally. The mask grants the following benefits and effects:
>
> **Sight of Secrets:** The wearer cannot see the physical world but gains the ability to perceive the hidden fears, thoughts, and secrets of creatures within 30 feet. This manifests as faint, ghostly images or whispers that reveal surface emotions, concealed intentions, or recent memories tied to fear or guilt. The wearer can use an action to focus on a creature and learn one secret or fear it harbors (DM’s discretion).
>
> **Inward Gaze:** Each time the wearer uses the mask’s power, the mask feeds on their own hidden fears and doubts. After using the Sight of Secrets, the wearer must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion as the mask drains their mental resilience.
>
> **Blindness to the World:** While wearing the mask, the wearer is blinded. They cannot see anything, including their own hands. All Wisdom (Perception) checks relying on sight automatically fail. However, the wearer gains advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks relying on hearing, smell, or touch.
>
> **Sometimes, It Blinks:** At the start of the wearer’s turn, there is a 10% chance the mask briefly “blinks,” restoring normal vision for 1 round. During this time, the wearer cannot use the Sight of Secrets but can see normally and interact with the world as usual.
>
>#### Curse
>___
>
>The Inverted Mask is cursed. Once attuned, the wearer cannot remove it unless a remove curse spell or similar magic is used. The curse deepens the wearer’s paranoia and fear, and over time, the wearer may become obsessed with uncovering secrets, alienating allies and friends

	{{Night-Tuned Diadem
Forged for the Eternal Stage, this blackened crown vibrates with low, inaudible frequencies. When worn, it synchronizes the mind to unseen rhythms—granting clairaudience of whispers in the dark. But the longer it's worn, the less the wearer hears the real world. Most never remove it. Some can’t.

>
>
>#### Properties
>___
>
>While attuned and wearing the Night-Tuned Diadem, you gain the Clairaudience spell, usable at will, allowing you to hear whispers and faint sounds up to 1 mile away, even through solid barriers. The whispers sound like faint murmurs or echoes from the shadows.
>
>The diadem grants advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing in darkness or dim light.
>
>However, the longer you wear the diadem continuously, the more your connection to the real world’s sounds fades. For each hour worn beyond 1 hour in a single stretch, you suffer a cumulative -1 penalty on Perception checks relying on hearing for the next hour after removal (maximum -5).
>
>If worn for more than 8 hours continuously, you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become charmed by the diadem, unable to remove it without a remove curse spell or similar magic. While charmed, you are obsessed with listening to the “eternal stage” and may ignore your surroundings.

	{{The Blacklight Marotte
This warped jester’s wand is carved from dark wood, topped with a featureless, smooth white head. In normal light, the head appears blank and unremarkable. However, when exposed to ultraviolet light or a similar magical effect that reveals hidden details, a sinister painted grin appears on the face, shifting subtly as if alive, unsettling those who look upon it.

> **Hidden Grin:** While the marotte’s head is illuminated by ultraviolet light, the painted grin becomes visible and seems to shift whenever observed, imposing disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks made to discern the true expression or intent of the wielder.
>
> **Phantasmal Scream (1/day):** As an action, the attuned wielder can activate the Blacklight Marotte. It emits a high-pitched, ghostly scream audible only to creatures with a guilty conscience within 60 feet. Creatures who have committed a grievous wrongdoing (DM’s discretion) must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. The scream continues until one of the following occurs:
>
> 1. A creature within range laughs heartily, breaking the tension and silencing the scream.
>
> 2. A creature affected by the scream fails a saving throw by 5 or more and breaks down emotionally or mentally, ending the effect.
>
> The scream’s eerie nature causes an unsettling atmosphere, making social interactions tense and uneasy for those who hear it.

	{{Tangle’s Memory Stitch
This filament-thin strand of gleaming wire vibrates with silent thoughts. Once belonging to Tangle, it was used to repair fractured minds—though just as often, it unraveled them. When threaded through the temples of a willing subject, it can restore or erase memories with surgical precision. But every stitch trades a truth for a lie.

>
>
>#### Properties
>___
>
> **Memory Repair:** As an action, you can carefully thread the wire through the temples of a willing creature. The subject regains one expended Hit Die or one level of exhaustion is removed. Additionally, the subject can recall a specific memory lost or obscured within the last year, regaining full clarity of that event.
>
> **Memory Erasure:** Alternatively, you can use the wire to erase a single memory from the subject’s mind, chosen by you and the subject collaboratively. This memory must be at least 24 hours old. The erased memory fades completely and cannot be recalled by any means short of a wish spell.
>
> **Truth-Lie Exchange:** Each time you use the wire to repair or erase a memory, you must sacrifice a truth you know personally. The next time you speak a statement of fact, you must instead speak a plausible lie, knowingly and convincingly, or suffer disadvantage on all Charisma (Deception) checks until you do. This effect lasts until the next dawn.

	{{The Hollow Invitation
This matte-black envelope is cold to the touch and sealed with a drop of black wax shaped like a grinning theatrical mask. The envelope cannot be opened by any mundane or magical means until it chooses to reveal its contents. Attempts to force it open cause the wax seal to glow faintly and the envelope to remain firmly shut

The envelope cannot be opened by any mundane or magical means until it chooses to reveal its contents. Attempts to force it open cause the wax seal to glow faintly and the envelope to remain firmly shut.
>
>When the envelope finally opens—often at an unpredictable time and place—the enclosed parchment bears only a single line of elegant, shifting script:
>
> *"You are summoned to the Banquet."*
>
>As soon as a creature reads the invitation, they immediately forget their name, their past, and their purpose, as if a veil of amnesia has fallen over their mind. They retain their skills, languages, and general knowledge but lose all personal memories and motivations. The creature gains a powerful, irresistible compulsion to seek out and attend the Banquet, an enigmatic event known only through whispered legends.
>
>The Banquet’s location is never written on the invitation and cannot be discerned by divination magic or scrying while the compulsion persists. The creature must follow instinct, rumors, and cryptic signs to find the Banquet.
>
>#### Mechanics
>___
>
>The compulsion acts like a geas spell with no saving throw, compelling the creature to travel toward the Banquet. The DM determines the Banquet’s location and how the creature discovers it.
The amnesia effect is similar to the modify memory spell but permanent until the Banquet is attended or the curse is broken.
The invitation can only be destroyed by attending the Banquet or by a wish spell.
>
>### Curse
>The Hollow Invitation is cursed. Removing or discarding the envelope does not end the effects. Only by attending the Banquet or powerful magic can the curse be lifted. Those who never attend remain lost in a haze of forgotten identity, wandering endlessly in search of a place they cannot remember.

	{{The Maw Mirror Shard

>
>#### Properties
>___
>
>While holding the shard and gazing into it for at least 1 minute, you see a reflection that represents your inner self. This reflection may appear twisted, hollow, fierce, or even speak to you in a voice only you can hear. The reflection’s appearance and demeanor are unique to each individual and can change subtly over time.
The shard grants advantage on Insight checks to discern deception or hidden motives, as it attunes you to the truth within others and yourself.
>
>Once per day, as an action, you can ask the shard a single question about the true intentions or nature of a creature you can see within 60 feet. The shard’s reflection will respond with a cryptic phrase or image. This ability functions like a limited Divination spell (save DC 15 to resist if the target is unwilling).
>
>If you gaze into the shard for more than 10 minutes continuously, you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute as unsettling visions of your deepest fears and desires overwhelm you.
>
>### Curse
>Rarely, the reflection may step out from the shard as a shadowy, intangible double of you (use the Shadow stat block, but it cannot attack and disappears after 1 minute or if it takes any damage). This happens at the DM’s discretion, often as a sign of great internal conflict or impending danger.

	{{The Forgotten Plush
This small, dusty animatronic plush is stitched with age and surprisingly warm to the touch. Its fabric is faded, and its joints creak softly when moved. The plush’s face subtly shifts whenever it is unobserved, cycling through expressions of joy, sorrow, and sometimes something unsettlingly neutral.

>
>#### Properties
>___
>
> **Unseen Expression:** While no creature is directly looking at the plush, its face changes to a new expression chosen by the DM, reflecting emotions like happiness, sadness, anger, or fear. This change is silent and instantaneous once out of sight. 
>
> **Return to Hand:** If thrown or dropped, the plush magically returns to the hand of the last creature who touched it at the start of their next turn, regardless of distance or barriers (as long as the creature is on the same plane).
>
> **Name Whisper:** The moment a creature first touches the plush, it magically learns that creature’s name and can whisper it softly to itself when nearby (within 30 feet). This whisper is audible only to the creature whose name is spoken and can be a comforting or unsettling presence depending on the plush’s current expression.
>
> **Emotional Bond:** If the plush is held for 1 hour, the holder gains advantage on Insight checks to read emotions and intentions for the next 24 hours.
>
>### Curse
>The plush is subtly cursed. Once bonded, if the plush is lost or taken more than 1 mile away from its bonded owner for over 24 hours, the owner begins to hear faint, sorrowful whispers calling to the plush. This causes disadvantage on Wisdom saving throws and ability checks until the plush is recovered or the curse is removed by a remove curse spell.
