Artifacts of the Hollow Banquet & Beyond

{{The Mask of Still Laughter

The Mask of Still Laughter
Wondrous Item (worn), rare (requires attunement by a bard, warlock, or sorcerer)

This cracked porcelain jester’s mask bears a wide, unmoving grin. Its surface is faintly warm, as if suppressing a laugh. When worn, the mask adheres to the face with unnatural ease, muffling the wearer’s true voice beneath a mirthful tone that is not their own.

While wearing the Mask of Still Laughter, you gain the following benefits:

You have advantage on Charisma (Performance) and Charisma (Deception) checks made to entertain or distract.

As a bonus action, you can force one creature within 30 feet that can hear you to make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target becomes unnerved, having disadvantage on the next attack roll or ability check it makes before the end of its next turn.

Once per long rest, you can unleash the mask’s cursed laughter. Each creature of your choice within 30 feet must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be incapacitated with unsettling laughter for 1 minute. An affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. Creatures that are immune to being charmed are unaffected.

Curse.
Once attuned, you cannot remove the Mask of Still Laughter unless you are targeted by a remove curse spell or similar magic. While attuned, you feel a constant compulsion to speak in a humorous or mocking tone, even during moments of pain or despair. Each time you fail a Charisma (Performance) check made to entertain an audience, you must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or suffer 1 level of exhaustion as the mask laughs in your voice, feeding on your failure.

If the wearer is reduced to 0 hit points, the mask detaches, floats briefly, and emits a single, echoing chuckle before falling inert for 1d6 days.

{{Remnant Core

Remnant Core
Wondrous Item, very rare (requires attunement by a creature with a soul)

This glassy orb, no larger than an apple, hums softly with the residual essence of a soul clinging to unfulfilled memories. A faint warmth radiates from within, and holding it conjures emotions—loss, longing, and fleeting joy. The whispers inside are soft, childlike, and sorrowful, surfacing in moments of silence or darkness.

While attuned to the Remnant Core, you gain the following benefits:

You have resistance to necrotic and psychic damage.

You gain advantage on death saving throws, and if you die while attuned to the Core, roll a d20. On a 17–20, your soul clings to the Core and you are instead stabilized at 0 HP with 1 level of exhaustion.

Undead creatures instinctively sense the Core within 60 feet and must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw to willingly attack you. On a failed save, the creature is compelled to watch you instead, unable to act on its first turn in combat.

Once per long rest, you may cast revivify (no material components required). When you do, the Core dims, and you cannot use this feature again until you finish a long rest.

Phantom Pulse (1/Day).
As an action, you can release a pulse of lingering soul-energy. Choose up to three creatures (living or undead) within 30 feet. Each must make a DC 16 Charisma saving throw:

On a failed save, a living creature is overwhelmed by memories of grief and loss, becoming incapacitated until the end of its next turn. An undead creature instead becomes stunned and emits a faint sobbing sound.

On a successful save, the target is unaffected.

Curse.
The Core is not without cost. Each time you use the Phantom Pulse or revivify feature, roll a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the whispering grows louder, and you gain vulnerability to psychic damage until the end of your next long rest.
